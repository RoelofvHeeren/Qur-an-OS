Other\nstories (e.g., Joseph and Job) focus on moral lessons.\n☼ The Unseen (e.g., the belief in Allah and His qualities, as well as\nangels, resurrection, judgment, etc.), which reaffirms one’s faith in the\ndivine through one’s heart, not eyes.\nSome chapters contain more than one theme, and some individual verses\nmay touch on a theme not presented here, but the following table represents\nthe general themes covered in the body of the text.\n***\n\n-- 4 of 694 --\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nABOUT THE TRANSLATOR\nACKNOWLEGMENTS\nTRANSLATOR’S NOTES\nINTRODUCTION\nSTYLISTIC FEATURES OF THE QURAN\nNOTES ON TRANSLATION\nTRANSLITERATION GUIDE\nMAP OF ARABIA AND AREA IN THE 7th CENTURY\nTHE CLEAR QURAN\n۩ ◙ ☼ 1.

He was a member of the first team that translated the Ramadan night\nprayers (Tarawîḥ) live from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet’s\nMosque in Medina (2002-2005). He memorized the entire Quran at a young\nage, and later obtained a professional ijâzah in the Ḥafṣ style of recitation\nwith a chain of narrators going all the way to Prophet Muḥammad\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Dr. Khattab received his Ph.D., M.A., and B.A. in Islamic Studies\nin English with Honors from Al-Azhar University’s Faculty of Languages\n& Translation. He lectured on Islam at Clemson University (OLLI Program,\n2009-2010), held the position of Lecturer at Al-Azhar University for over a\ndecade starting in 2003, and served as the Muslim Chaplain at Brock\nUniversity (2014-2016). He is a member of the Canadian Council of Imams\nand a Fulbright Interfaith Scholar. He has served as an Imam in the U.S.A.\nand Canada since 2007 and is the author of The Nation of Islam (2011) and\nOutfoxing Fox News (2017), and contributor to the Encyclopedia of Muslim\nAmerican History (2010). His forthcoming works include: Qamus-ul-Quran\n(The Dictionary of Quranic Vocabulary), The Illustrated Clear Quran for\nKids, and Shukran: the Grateful Young Man.\n***\n\n-- 10 of 694 --\n\nACKNOWLEGMENTS\nFirst I praise the Almighty for His guidance and assistance.

On the way home I had an unlikely\nencounter, since all my cab-drivers in Toronto had been Muslims so far.\nThat day my driver was non-Muslim, so he was able to identify me as\nMuslim simply because of my traditional Arab garb. Out of nowhere, he\ncommented, “I think Muslims are good, but Islam is evil!” Taken aback by\nthis Fox News style rhetoric, I responded, “Well, first of all thanks for the\ncompliment about Muslims, but why do you think Islam is bad?” He\nreplied, “Because your holy book calls me an animal.” In astonishment, I\nanswered, “I know the whole Quran by heart and I don’t think it says that\nanywhere!” He cited 8:55, and I responded by telling him that the word\ndâbbah in Arabic does not mean an animal but a living being (see 24:45).\nHe persisted, saying that his translation says so. I later checked many\npopular translations by Muslims and non-Muslims and realized that the man\nwas right. This fateful encounter opened my eyes to the rampant\nmisrepresentations of the Quran.\nThe Quran was revealed to Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the 7th\ncentury and was not translated into English by a Muslim until the 20th\ncentury. Many Muslims had long believed that the Quran should only be\nread in Arabic, the original language of revelation. This led to many\ninaccurate, ill-willed translations by missionaries and orientalists—which\nexplains why we still see some words like ‘holy war’ and ‘infidels’ as well\nas many theological inaccuracies in some existing translations. All this\nleads to endless false assumptions about Islam and Muslims. Some Muslim\ntranslators are no better off than their non-Muslim counterparts because\nthey are not well-versed in Arabic, or English, or Islamic studies, or\ntranslation, or all of the above. Looking up words in an Arabic-English\ndictionary or copying earlier translations when frustrated does not always\nguarantee accuracy in translation. There are some noteworthy modern\ntranslations like that of Dr. Ahmad Zaki Hammad (2007) and Dr. M.A.S.\nAbdel Haleem (2004), but many are either overtranslated, making it\n\n-- 13 of 694 --\n\ndifficult for laypeople to understand, or undertranslated, doing a great\ndisservice to the Quran. This is why I saw a need for an accurate, smooth,\nand accessible translation.\nTo achieve accuracy, I have made use of the greatest and most\ncelebrated works of old and modern tafsîr (Quran commentaries), and\nshared the work with several Imams in North America for feedback and\ninsight. For clarity, every effort has been made to select easy to understand\nwords and phrases that reflect the beauty and power of the original text.\nAlong with informative footnotes, verses have been grouped and titled\nbased on their themes for a better understanding of the sûrahs, their main\nconcepts, and internal coherence.\nThanks to our editing and proofreading teams led by Abu-Isa Webb, I\nbelieve that what you are holding in your hands now is the most accurate\nand eloquent translation of the Final Revelation: The Clear Quran.\nMustafa Khattab\n***\n\n-- 14 of 694 --\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe first translation of the Quran into English was done in 1649 by\nAlexander Ross. Since that first translation, many more attempts have been\nmade to penetrate the work from an outside, academic point of view, but it\nwasn’t until the early 20th century that the Quran was first translated by\nMuslims. In 1934, Abdullah Yusuf Ali published one of the most widely\ncirculated translations to date.\nAside from concerns about academia and orientalism, translating the\nQuran can be an enormous task even for the sincere of heart. Arabic, as a\nSemitic language, has words that have meanings and shades of meanings\nwhich do not easily move over into English, and total mastery of both\nlanguages is needed before any truly satisfactory translation can be put\nforward. Translators also struggle to render what they believe to be the right\nmeaning into a foreign language—knowing that it is almost impossible to\nreflect the Arabic style, rhythms, and figures of speech, while also\nstruggling with different interpretations of the original Arabic words.\nThe development of linguistics, current events, and the gradual drift of\nthe English language puts us in an important time to move forward in\nQuranic translations. For the most part, a lack of understanding Arabic can\nbe seen in older, less popular works from European scholars, however\nmistakes and errors are persistent in more modern copies, and blunders can\neven be found in the likes of Yusuf Ali when he writes, “those who believe\nnot in the hereafter name the angels with female names.” (53:27) A brief\nsurvey of names such as Gabriel, Michael, and Mâlik offers no female\nnames whatsoever. Keeping in mind that some pagan Arabs believed that\nthe angels were Allah’s daughters, the true translation can be rendered,\n“those who do not believe in the Hereafter label the angels as female.”\nThe failure to understand the complex forms of Classical Arabic found\nin the Quran, and sometimes found only in the Quran, can be a stumbling\nblock for many scholars, but even those with a strong understanding of\nArabic need to have their intelligence backed with the wisdom found in a\n\n-- 15 of 694 --\n\nsound theological background. Without understanding the religious context\nof the Quran, such mistakes can be made as when Muhsin Khan &\nMuhammad al-Hilali write, “Allah will never lead a people astray after He\nhas guided them until He makes clear to them as to what they should\navoid.” (9:115). In context, the verse is instructing the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and\nhis companions that they should no longer pray to Allah for the forgiveness\nof polytheists after their death. As pointed out by Ibn Kathîr, drawing on the\nunderstanding of Aṭ-Ṭabari, the meaning is clearly “Allah would never\nconsider a people deviant after He has guided them, until He makes clear to\nthem what they must avoid.”\nFor these reasons it is clear that any translation of the Quran must be\nled by scholars with a profound understanding of the theological context of\nthe Quran, as well as a native understanding of Arabic, but also\nconsiderable training in the meaning of the Classical Arabic particular to\nthe Quran. These three things enable a scholar to truly understand the\nQuran, and a profound understanding is the first step towards a good\ntranslation.\nOf course, a firm understanding of Arabic is not all that is needed in\norder to translate the Quran effectively. The Quran states repeatedly that it\nis accessible, clear, and easy to understand, so it would be an error to\ntranslate it into dense or inaccessible language. Naturally, the academic\ntraditions that first dealt with translating the Quran value language density,\nand the religious and scholarly traditions of the English language assume a\ncorrelation between complexity of language and truth. This correlation has\nbeen carried over into translations of the Quran despite complexity, density,\nand inaccessibility being tenets far from Islamic scholarly tradition. What\nwe are left with are translations that, though they may be technically\ncorrect, miss the simplicity, vigour, or eloquence of the original in favour of\na contrived sense of divinity.\nTwo striking examples of overinflated, though accurate, English\ntranslations come to mind. First, M.M. Pickthall writes, “Be modest in thy\nbearing and subdue thy voice. Lo! the harshest of all voices is the voice of\nthe ass.” (31:19) In today’s English, this can only be read as a rather vulgar\nstatement, especially by non-academic readers and should instead be\n\n-- 16 of 694 --\n\nrendered, “Be moderate in your pace and lower your voice, for the ugliest\nof all voices is certainly the braying of donkeys.” Second, T.B. Irving writes\nof 44:16, “Some day We will kidnap everyone in the greatest operation; We\nshall be Avenged!” Giving Allah a distinctly immature, vindictive, and even\nrueful voice where a more appropriate translation is, “˹On˺ the Day We will\ndeal ˹you˺ the fiercest blow, We will surely inflict punishment.”\nThe tone of the Quran, as a revelation for all humanity, relies heavily\non a number of emotions as well, and a poor understanding of English can\nlead even great scholars of Arabic into error with translation. There are\nnumerous instances in the Quran of sarcasm and wit, which are often lost\nentirely in complicated and fragile grammar structures. Elegance and prose\nare also usually cast out of translations, especially when scholars use a rigid\nword-for-word replacement technique to encode Arabic into a mock-\nEnglish cypher that sometimes gives the opposite meaning of what is\nintended in the verse. The problem with undervaluing the subtleties and\nintricacies of human language can be underlined by examining the work of\nDr. M. Mahmoud Ghali. He translates 4:105, “and do not be a constant\nadversary of the treacherous.” The true translation of this verse is, “so do\nnot be an advocate for the deceitful.” Another example is his English\ntranslation of the Arabic word ‘khair’ to ‘charity’. The Arabic term ‘khair’\nhas multiple meanings and often has nothing to do with charitable giving.\nInstances of such inaccuracy transform the meaning of Quranic verses. For\nexample, 100:8 reads “And surely he is indeed constantly (passionate) in\nhis love for charity,” where “love for charity” in fact refers to “greed for\n˹worldly˺ gains.” Likewise, 33:25, which speaks of the enemy alliance that\nlaid a siege around Muslims in Medina, reads “they attained no charity,”\nwhereas the verse actually talks about “war gains.”\nIn respecting the order and particulars of the Arabic words being used,\nthe meaning of dozens of idioms are lost in translation, hundreds of\nsentences become a tangled mess of improper grammar, and the flow and\nease of reading is entirely lost. It is better to respect the meaning and power\nof the Quran than the language it happened to be revealed in, otherwise one\nmight end up with the near blasphemous statement found in the Ṣaḥeeḥ\nInternational translation, “They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten\nthem.” (9:67) Surely Allah does not ‘forget’ anything or anyone (see\n\n-- 17 of 694 --\n\n20:52). Google Translate might give up a similar translation, but the\nmeaning is poetic, it is much closer to ‘neglect.’ Both parties are aware of\neach other, but when humans neglect their duties to Allah, He neglects them\nin the Fire: “They neglected Allah, so He neglected them.”\nAside from these more theologically problematic translation issues,\nthere are dozens of simple grammar structures in the Quran that are easy,\nclear, or beautiful in Arabic, but entirely untranslatable. Rather than try to\nfit the English structures and words into a foreign context, it is much better\nto accept English for what it has to offer and use its own native poetry and\nbalance to create a translation that carries the real meaning and power of the\nPerfect Book.\nWith grammar and the particularities of translating aside, a\nconsiderable understanding of the context of the Quranic revelation itself as\nwell as the stories found within is needed in order to render a proper\nEnglish translation. For example, the word ‘corn’ is no longer used to\ndescribe all forms of grain, yet many translations still use this word to\ndescribe the fields in the dream of the King in the story of Joseph (12:43\nand 46). When Yusuf Ali first wrote this in 1934, it may have been\nacceptable to refer to wheat as a kind of corn, but in modern vocabulary this\nis totally unheard of, yet many translations simply erroneously copy that\nword into their own works.\nIt is clear that the modern age demands not only a great scholar of\nArabic and the Quran to come to the table, but also a modern, adaptable\nscholar of the English language, as well as someone with native fluency\nwho knows how the translation will be received.\nThe reception of the Quran by English audiences now indicates a third\nstage in the historical development of Quran translation. At first it was an\nacademic exercise, a curious study of the ‘other.’ Next, Muslims translated\nthe Quran as a matter of love or pride, and they shared it among themselves.\nWith this long history and background, and a team of experts in the Quran\nand in the English language, the struggle we now face is transmitting the\nreal beauty and message of the Quran to Muslims and non-Muslims alike\nwho are interested in it and who also know and love English.\n\n-- 18 of 694 --\n\nThe Alcoran of Ross was the first small step forward, and Yusuf Ali’s\nThe Holy Qur’an was a turning point in the history of the Quran in English.\nThe next step is to overcome the obstacles outlined here and to deliver\nAllah’s Final Testament to English speaking audiences like never before.\nThe next step is The Clear Quran.\n***\n\n-- 19 of 694 --\n\nSTYLISTIC FEATURES OF THE QURAN\nThe Quran was revealed in 7th century Arabia, where people took so much\npride in their mastery of Arabic that literary fairs were commonly held and\nprized poems were inscribed in gold for all to see. The Quran, which is\nbelieved to be Allah’s inimitable Word, is a literary miracle, unmatched by\nany other work of Arabic literature. While Arabic has served as the medium\nfor communicating the Quranic message, the Quran has forever changed the\nlandscape of Arabic literary tradition, promoting Arabic to a leading world\nlanguage and influencing other languages including Farsi, Urdu, Swahili,\nTurkish, Spanish, and many others. Several sciences have emerged to serve\nthe Quran such as tafsîr (Quranic commentary), taw\nḥîd (theology), fiqh\n(jurisprudence), tajwîd (phonetic rules of recitation), qirâ'ât (styles of\nrecitation), naḥw and\nṣarf (grammar and morphology), balâghah (rhetoric),\nand kha\nṭṭ (calligraphy). Algebra was also developed in part to solve issues\nrelated to the distribution of inheritance shares laid out in Sûrah 4. Together\nwith the Sunnah or the example of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), the Quran is the\nbedrock of Muslim civilization and the main source of Islamic law and\npractice. The following are some of the distinctive stylistic features of the\nQuran in its original Arabic form.\nStructure\nThe body of the Quran is made up of 6236 verses (or âyât, plural of âyah,\nwhich literally means sign, proof, or miracle), composed of 114 sûrahs (or\nchapters) in more than 600 pages. A sûrah usually takes its name from the\nmain theme, a story, or a distinctive word within it. With the exception of\nSûrah 9, all sûrahs begin with the basmalah: “In the Name of Allah—the\nMost Compassionate, Most Merciful.” Depending on their respective sûrah,\nverses typically rhyme and vary in length—some are long (2:282 is the\nlongest at fifteen lines long), while others are short (20:1 is the shortest at\nonly two Arabic letters). The Quran is divided into 30 parts (or ajzâ', plural\nof juz'), each with 8 subparts (or arbâ’, plural of rub’), making it\nconvenient for reading and memorization.\n\n-- 20 of 694 --\n\nOf the Quran’s 114 sûrahs, eighty-six are classified as Meccan because\nthey were revealed before the Prophet’s emigration to Medina. These\nsûrahs focus mainly on restoring the belief in the One True God. The other\ntwenty-eight sûrahs are categorized as Medinian since they were revealed\nafter the Prophet’s emigration from Mecca with an emphasis on the\ncommandments regarding a Muslim’s relationship with their Lord, their\nfellow humans, and the rest of Allah’s creation. Some Meccan sûrahs may\nhave Medinian verses and vice versa. Sûrahs and passages were revealed\nover a period of twenty-three years to address issues facing the Muslim\ncommunity. As instructed by Allah through the angel Gabriel, the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) ordered his scribes to arrange sûrahs mostly according to their\nlengths, with the longest sûrahs first, not chronologically.\nAlthough the Quran is not arranged chronologically, the sûrahs are\nperfectly interrelated. Some of the stories or themes that are touched on\npassingly in one sûrah are explained in detail in the next sûrah (see 12:105\nand 13:1-17). In some cases, both the end of a sûrah and the beginning of\nthe next sûrah cover the same subject (see 53:57-62 and 54:1-5). One sûrah\nmight give some stories and the next will continue the narrative by adding\nmore stories (see sûrahs 37 and 38). Additionally, two consecutive sûrahs\nmight cover the exact same themes, but in a different order (see sûrahs 55\nand 56).\nQuranic sûrahs have diverse themes, with main overarching subjects\n(e.g., verses 2:221-242), interjected by secondary subjects (e.g., verses\n2:238-239). In essence, all themes have a common denominator: one’s\nrelationship with their Creator and the rest of His creation. Assuming that\nnot everyone will read the Quran in its entirety, readers will run into this\ncommon denominator at any given sûrah.\nStyle\nWith the word ‘Quran’ (lit., recitation) repeated about seventy times, the\nQuran is unique in that it actually speaks about itself, its Revealer, its\npurpose, its devotees, and its detractors. The author of this profound book is\nnowhere to be found on the cover; rather He reveals Himself on every page,\nspeaking with authority, offering compelling proofs, giving commandments\nto prophets, believers, and all of humanity.\n\n-- 21 of 694 --\n\nPerhaps one of the most visible stylistic features of the Quran is\nrepetition, which comes in three different forms:\n1) Repetitive phrases such as “Then which of your Lord’s favours will you\nboth deny?” which appears a total of thirty-one times in Sûrah 55 and “Woe\non that Day to the deniers!” which appears ten times in Sûrah 77. Far from\nredundancy, the purpose of repetition in these two instances is to create an\nimpact by reinforcing the point being made—to acknowledge Allah’s many\nblessings in the former and deter people from denying Allah in the latter.\nThis rhetorical device is still employed by many modern orators. One of the\nmost notable examples is the repetition of “I have a dream” and “Let\nfreedom ring” in Martin Luther King’s 1963 famous speech.\n2) Repetitive themes such as the arguments for Allah’s oneness,\nuniqueness, and power in sûrahs 16, 35, and 112; the comparison between\nParadise and Hell in sûrahs 37, 39, 40, and 41; and the horrors of Judgment\nDay in sûrahs 77, 78, 79, 80, and 81. The purpose is to emphasize a\nrecurring theme (e.g., the reward of the believers and disbelievers) or\npresent more details (e.g., the testimony of bodily organs in 41:19-24 and\nthe fruit of the Zaqqûm tree in 37:62-68).\n3) Repetitive stories such as the story of Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in sûrahs 7, 18,\n26, and 28 and Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in sûrahs 2, 6, 19, and 37. The purpose is\nto reassure the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and focus on a different aspect of the life\nof these prophets. For example, the highlights of the story of Moses\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in Sûrah 7 are the arrogance of Pharaoh, the defeat of the\nmagicians, and the suffering of the Children of Israel. In Sûrah 26, the focus\nshifts to Moses’ childhood, his unintentional killing of an Egyptian man, as\nwell as his escape to Midian and his marriage.\nThe fact that these repetitive themes and stories are perfectly\nconsistent, despite having been revealed over the course of two decades to\nan unlettered prophet, is yet another proof of the divine source of the Quran.\nThe Quran contains some fascinating numerical patterns. For example,\n‘Paradise’ and ‘Hell’ are each repeated 77 times, ‘angels’ and ‘devils’ 88\ntimes, ‘world’ and ‘Hereafter’ 115 times, ‘prayers’ (\nṣalawât) 5 times (the\nexact number of daily prayers), ‘punishment’ 117 times, whereas\n\n-- 22 of 694 --\n\n‘forgiveness’ is repeated double that number, 234 times. ‘Day’ is repeated\n365 times (the average number of days in the year), ‘days’ 30 times (the\naverage number of days in the month), and ‘month’ 12 times (the number of\nmonths in the year).\nSarcasm is another common feature of the Quran, especially when it\ntalks about the fate of those who ridicule the truth (see 24:53 and 44:49). So\nreaders can expect to see a warning such as: “Give them good news of a\npainful punishment.” This style aims at paying the ridiculers back in kind as\nwell as adding more intensity to the warning.\nMany passages in the Quran utilize a preferential style called taf\nḍîl—\nthat is to say, two things share a certain quality but one of them supersedes\nthe other. For example, the Quran says repeatedly that the people of\nPharaoh were more powerful and resourceful than the people of Mecca.\nHowever, some structures look like taf\nḍîl but do not actually signify a\ncomparison in quality. The assumption that both sides share the same\nquality but one is greater than the other is what causes confusion in most\ntranslations of the Quran. For example, when 12:33 suggests that going to\nprison is dearer to Joseph (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) than committing adultery, this does not\nmean that either option is dear to him. Similarly, 17:84 suggests that the\nbelievers’ Way is better in guidance than that of the pagans, but in truth the\nlatter is not guided at all. Furthermore, 11:78 suggests that Lot (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\ninstructs men that the single women of his nation are purer for marriage\nthan other men, when other men are not pure for marriage in the first place.\nEmphasis\nEmphasis is commonplace in the Quran, especially where a concept is\nlikely to be challenged by the skeptics. Sometimes one or more emphasis\nwords are used, such as ‘surely,’ ‘indeed,’ and ‘certainly’ (see 15:9). The\nrepetition of a sentence two consecutive times is also used as emphasis,\nsuch as 102:3-4: “But no! You will soon come to know. Again, no! You will\nsoon come to know.” The repetition of a verb in its noun form can also be\nused to similar effect. If translated literally, 56:4 will read, “When the earth\nwill be shaken with a shaking,” whereas the meaning is: “When the earth\nwill be violently shaken.” Lastly, an oath is one of the most common forms\nof emphasis. Allah has the right to swear by any of His creation, such as the\n\n-- 23 of 694 --\n\nsun and the moon, the day and night, the heaven and earth (91:1-6).\nHowever, a Muslim can only swear by Allah.\nPersons, Time, and Place\nTo prove its divine nature, the Quran often refers to past events that were\nnot known to anyone at the time of the revelation (see 12:25-42 and 27:17-\n28), constantly reminding the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) that, since he was not an\neyewitness to these events, it was through divine revelation that he came to\nknow about them (see 12:102). The Quran also foretells future events that\nwere later proven true (see 30:1-6 and 48:27).\nUnlike English, the Arabic language has only three tenses: past,\npresent, and future. The Quran is unique in using the past tense to refer to\nfuture events, particularly when it describes the Day of Judgment (see\n39:68-75). In addition to reminding us that Allah is not bound by the limits\nof time, the aim is to give the impression that these events are so certain to\nhappen that it is as if they have already happened. However, when these\nsentences are translated into English (or any other language for that matter),\nthe future tense is used.\nGeneralizations are also common in the Quran, where “the people,” or\n“the Jews,” etc., actually refers to a small group that said or did something\nthat was not challenged by the larger group (see 5:64).\nWith some exceptions, the Quran does not dwell on the names of\npersons, places, or times (see for example 2:259, 12:21-23, and 18:9-26).\nRather, attention is usually focused on the moral of the story, making it\nvalid for every people, time, and place.\nTo express the greatness and magnitude of a definite noun (such as the\nStraight Path, the Merciful Lord, etc.), the Quran often uses that name in an\nindefinite form (a Straight Path, a Merciful Lord, etc.), but this translation\nuses the definite form in these instances in order to maintain the true\nmeaning in English.\nThe Quran states that the pleasures which Allah has prepared for the\nbelievers in Paradise are beyond human comprehension (see 32:17). Hence,\ngeneric terms (e.g., rivers, gardens, fruits, garments of silk, bracelets of\ngold, etc.) are often used to describe these pleasures in an appealing way,\n\n-- 24 of 694 --\n\nbringing it down to our level of understanding, whereas the realities of\nParadise are far beyond these descriptions. These terms are no different than\nthose one would have used in 1876 C.E. to describe a cutting-edge\nsmartphone to Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.\nLetters and Pronouns\nOf the twenty-nine letters of the Arabic alphabet, only fourteen appear in\nvarious combinations at the beginning of twenty-nine sûrahs of the Quran.\nThese letters are: Nũn,\nṢãd,\nḤa, Kãf, Ya, Mĩm, Qãf, Alif,\nṬa, ’Aĩn, Lãm, Ha,\nSĩn, and Ra. According to Ibn Kathîr, a renowned Quran commentator, in\nhis explanation of 2:1, these letters can be arranged into an Arabic sentence\nthat reads ّ ﺺَﻧٌ ﻢْ ﻴِ ﻜَ ﺣ ٌ ﻊِ ﻃﺎَ ﻗ ٌ ﻪَ ﻟ ُّ\t ﺮِ ﺳ which roughly translates to: “A wise,\ndecisive text, full of wonders.” Although several theories have been\nsuggested by scholars regarding the meaning of these letters, it is\ncommonly believed that these letters are among the miracles of the Quran\nand, as such, no one knows their actual meaning except Allah.\nUnlike other conjunctions like fa َ ف (then/right after) and thumma \u0000 ﻢُ ﺛ\n(then/later), wa َ و (and) does not signify an order of events. The subjects of\n‘and’ clauses have sometimes been rearranged for better flow in English,\nsuch as ‘day and night’ instead of ‘night and day,’ ‘seen and unseen’ instead\nof ‘unseen and seen,’ etc. (see 35:19-22).\nOne of the first things that strikes novice readers of the Quran is that\nthe word ‘We’ is frequently used when Allah speaks (see 15:9-23). This\nplural form, known as the royal we, is employed to indicate reverence and\nnot number. Almost always, ‘Allah,’ ‘I,’ or ‘He’ is mentioned either before\nor after to emphasize Allah’s oneness.\nAnother visible stylistic feature is the ‘rotation of pronouns’ (iltifât)\nfound throughout the Quran, alternating between first person, second\nperson, and third person (see 17:1). If rendered verbatim into English this\nrhetorical device becomes entirely meaningless, as it is rarely found in any\nIndo-European language at all, and almost never in English.\nA similar feature is found in the referential nature of pronouns in either\nlanguage. In Classical Arabic, especially in the Quran, the repeated use of a\nsingle pronoun (such as ‘he’) rotates in reference, which is to say it first\n\n-- 25 of 694 --\n\nspeaks of the first speaker, then the next use speaks of the second speaker,\nthen back to the first, all using the same pronoun (see 26:24-31). In this\nway, repeatedly using “he said” would indicate a dialogue, whereas a direct\ntranslation of the conversation would be rendered as a monologue in\nEnglish. The same can be said of other pronouns such as ‘they.’\nThe Quranic Challenge\nUnlike any other scripture, the Quran poses a falsification test to those who\nchallenge its authenticity which, over time, was made easier and easier. The\nfirst challenge was to produce a similar book in Arabic (17:88). Next, the\nchallenge was reduced to only ten sûrahs (11:13). Finally, the challenge was\nto only produce one sûrah similar to it (10:38), and despite the shortest\nsûrah being only ten words (Sûrah 108), none have been able to match it.\nThe Quran also challenges readers to find contradictions (4:82). Some have\nattempted these challenges, only to prove their inability to match the\nelegance and eloquence of the divine revelation or their ignorance of the\nnuances of Arabic syntax and grammar.\n***\n\n-- 26 of 694 --\n\nNOTES ON TRANSLATION\nAllah’s names and attributes are capitalized as well as pronouns used to\nreference Him.\nProper nouns referring to events and cosmology are also capitalized, such\nas the Day of Judgment, the Day, the Hour, the Hereafter, Paradise, and\nHell.\nIn some cases, the use of a pronoun would be confusing or misleading, so it\nhas been replaced with the corresponding noun for clarity. Similarly, in\nsome places where the ‘rotation of pronouns’ (iltifât) is found in the\nArabic, pronouns have been altered in English to maintain pronoun\nagreement.\nGendered pronouns have been replaced with ‘they’ where the meaning is\nneutral, except in the case of Allah, Who is referred to as ‘He’ despite being\ngender-neutral in order to preserve the use of a singular pronoun, while\navoiding the use of ‘it.’\nUnless otherwise indicated, Biblical quotations are from The Holy Bible:\nInternational Standard Version, copyright © the ISV Foundation, 1996-\n2012.\nHalf brackets ˹˺ indicate words inserted into the English which do not\ndirectly correspond to Arabic words in the original text.\nThe most frequently used speech verb in the Quran is “said,” especially in\nconversation. To enrich conversations in English, several speech verbs are\nused in this translation (such as replied, cried, protested, pleaded, and\nthreatened), depending on the meaning (see 18:71-73).\nThe name “Muḥammad” appears only four times in the Quran. In some\ncases, words such as “Prophet” and “Messenger” are used to address him.\nBut most of the time, the Prophet is addressed in the second person “you,”\nthis is when “O Prophet” will be used between half brackets ˹˺ to indicate\nthat “you” is referring to Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and not to the believers or\nanyone else.\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n\n-- 27 of 694 --\n\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص is a calligraphic contraction of an Arabic phrase meaning ‘peace\nbe upon him,’ which is used respectfully after the mention of prophets\noutside the text of the Quran.\n“The Day of Judgment” and “Judgment Day” are equivalent and used\ninterchangeably based on the flow in English.\nAbbreviations used in this translation:\nA.H.

The Opening\n(Al-Fâti\nḥah)\nThis Meccan sûrah, which is recited a total of seventeen times in the five\ndaily prayers, serves as the cornerstone of the Quran. It sums up the\nrelationship between the Creator and His creation, Allah’s undisputed\nauthority in this world and the Hereafter, and humanity’s constant\ndependence on Him for guidance and assistance. The underlying theme\nis to acknowledge that He is the only god worthy of worship—a simple\ntruth which the disbelievers fail to grasp. All fundamental principles\nencapsulated in this sûrah are spelled out in the rest of the Quran.\nPrayer for Guidance\n1. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful. 2. All\npraise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,[1] 3. the Most Compassionate, Most\nMerciful, 4. Master of the Day of Judgment. 5. You ˹alone˺ we worship and\nYou ˹alone˺ we ask for help. 6. Guide us along the Straight Path, 7. the Path\nof those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who\nare astray.[2]\n***\n\n-- 33 of 694 --\n\n2. The Cow\n(Al-Baqarah)\nThis Medinian sûrah, which takes its name from the story of the cow in\nverses 67–73, details the main concepts of the previous sûrah, with\nemphasis on the qualities of the believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites;\nAllah’s power to create and resurrect; the enmity of Satan towards Adam\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his descendants; as well as Allah’s covenant with Moses\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and the Children of Israel. Several rulings are given in regards to\nmarital relationships, bequest, jihad, fasting, pilgrimage, donations, debts,\nand interest. Unlike the next sûrah, which focuses on the Christian\nperception of Jesus, this sûrah dedicates a sizable portion to Jewish\nattitudes and practices.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nQualities of the Believers\n1. Alif-Lãm-Mĩm.[3] 2. This is the Book! There is no doubt about it[4]—a\nguide for those mindful ˹of Allah˺,[5] 3. who believe in the unseen,[6]\nestablish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them, 4. and\nwho believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺[7] and what was\nrevealed before you, and have sure faith in the Hereafter. 5. It is they who\nare ˹truly˺ guided by their Lord, and it is they who will be successful.\nQualities of the Disbelievers\n6. As for those who persist in disbelief, it is the same whether you warn\nthem or not—they will never believe. 7. Allah has sealed their hearts and\ntheir hearing, and their sight is covered. They will suffer a tremendous\npunishment.\nQualities of the Hypocrites\n8. And there are some who say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day,” yet\nthey are not ˹true˺ believers. 9. They seek to deceive Allah and the\nbelievers, yet they only deceive themselves, but they fail to perceive it. 10.\nThere is sickness in their hearts, and Allah ˹only˺ lets their sickness\nincrease. They will suffer a painful punishment for their lies. 11. When they\n\n-- 34 of 694 --\n\nare told, “Do not spread corruption in the land,” they reply, “We are only\npeace-makers!”[8] 12. Indeed, it is they who are the corruptors, but they fail\nto perceive it. 13. And when they are told, “Believe as others believe,” they\nreply, “Will we believe as the fools believe?” Indeed, it is they who are\nfools, but they do not know. 14. When they meet the believers they say,\n“We believe.” But when alone with their evil associates they say, “We are\ndefinitely with you; we were only mocking.” 15. Allah will throw their\nmockery back at them, leaving them to continue wandering blindly in their\ndefiance. 16. They are the ones who trade guidance for misguidance. But\nthis trade is profitless, and they are not ˹rightly˺ guided.\nHypocrites’ Example\n17. Their example is that of someone who kindles a fire, but when it lights\nup all around them, Allah takes away their light, leaving them in complete\ndarkness—unable to see. 18. They are ˹wilfully˺ deaf, dumb, and blind, so\nthey will never return ˹to the Right Path˺.\nAnother Example\n19. Or ˹those caught in˺ a rainstorm from the sky with darkness, thunder,\nand lightning. They press their fingers into their ears at the sound of every\nthunder-clap for fear of death. And Allah encompasses the disbelievers ˹by\nHis might˺. 20. It is as if the lightning were about to snatch away their sight.\nWhenever lightning strikes, they walk in its light, but when darkness covers\nthem, they stand still. Had Allah willed, He could have taken away their\nhearing and sight. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.\nOrder to Worship Allah Alone\n21. O humanity! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before\nyou, so that you may become mindful ˹of Him˺. 22. ˹He is the One˺ Who\nhas made the earth a place of settlement for you and the sky a canopy; and\nsends down rain from the sky, causing fruits to grow as a provision for you.\nSo do not knowingly set up equals to Allah ˹in worship˺.\nThe Challenge of the Quran\n23. And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant,[9]\nthen produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what\nyou say is true. 24. But if you are unable to do so—and you will never be\n\n-- 35 of 694 --\n\nable to do so—then fear the Fire fuelled with people and stones, which is\nprepared for the disbelievers.\nReward of the Believers\n25. Give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to those who believe and do good that they\nwill have Gardens under which rivers flow. Whenever provided with fruit,\nthey will say, “This is what we were given before,” for they will be served\nfruit that looks similar ˹but tastes different˺. They will have pure spouses,\n[10] and they will be there forever.\nWisdom Behind Parables\n26. Surely Allah does not shy away from using the parable of a mosquito or\nwhat is even smaller. As for the believers, they know that it is the truth from\ntheir Lord. And as for the disbelievers, they argue, “What does Allah mean\nby such a parable?” Through this ˹test˺, He leaves many to stray, and guides\nmany. And He leaves none to stray except the rebellious— 27. those who\nviolate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever ˹ties˺\nAllah has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land. It is\nthey who are the ˹true˺ losers.\nAllah’s Creation\n28. How can you deny Allah? You were lifeless and He gave you life, then\nHe will cause you to die and again bring you to life, and then to Him you\nwill ˹all˺ be returned. 29. He is the One Who created everything in the earth\nfor you. Then He turned towards the heaven, forming it into seven heavens.\nAnd He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.\nHonouring Adam\n30. ˹Remember˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to place a\nsuccessive ˹human˺ authority on earth.” They asked ˹Allah˺, “Will You\nplace in it someone who will spread corruption there and shed blood while\nwe glorify Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” Allah responded, “I\nknow what you do not know.”[11] 31. He taught Adam the names of all\nthings, then He presented them to the angels and said, “Tell Me the names\nof these, if what you say is true?[12]” 32. They replied, “Glory be to You!\nWe have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are truly the\nAll-Knowing, All-Wise.” 33. Allah said, “O Adam! Inform them of their\nnames.” Then when Adam did, Allah said, “Did I not tell you that I know\n\n-- 36 of 694 --\n\nthe secrets of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and\nwhat you conceal?” 34. And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels,\n“Prostrate before Adam,”[13] so they all did—but not Iblîs,[14] who refused\nand acted arrogantly,[15] becoming unfaithful.\nTemptation and Fall\n35. We cautioned, “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat as\nfreely as you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be\nwrongdoers.” 36. But Satan deceived them—leading to their fall from the\n˹blissful˺ state they were in,[16] and We said, “Descend from the heavens ˹to\nthe earth˺ as enemies to each other.[17] You will find in the earth a residence\nand provision for your appointed stay.” 37. Then Adam was inspired with\nwords ˹of prayer˺ by his Lord,[18] so He accepted his repentance. Surely He\nis the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. 38. We said, “Descend all of\nyou! Then when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows it, there\nwill be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. 39. But those who disbelieve\nand deny Our signs will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there\nforever.”\nAdvice to the Israelites\n40. O children of Israel![19] Remember My favours upon you. Fulfil your\ncovenant and I will fulfil Mine, and stand in awe of Me ˹alone˺. 41. Believe\nin My revelations which confirm your Scriptures.[20] Do not be the first to\ndeny them or trade them for a fleeting gain.[21] And be mindful of Me. 42.\nDo not mix truth with falsehood or hide the truth knowingly. 43. Establish\nprayer, pay alms-tax,[22] and bow down with those who bow down.\nMore Advice\n44. Do you preach righteousness and fail to practice it yourselves, although\nyou read the Scripture? Do you not understand? 45. And seek help through\npatience and prayer. Indeed, it is a burden except for the humble— 46.\nthose who are certain that they will meet their Lord and to Him they will\nreturn.\nAllah’s Favours upon the Israelites 1) Honour\n47. O Children of Israel! Remember ˹all˺ the favours I granted you and how\nI honoured you above the others.[23] 48. Guard yourselves against the Day\n\n-- 37 of 694 --\n\non which no soul will be of help to another. No intercession[24] will be\naccepted, no ransom taken, and no help will be given.\nFavour 2) Ending Persecution\n49. ˹Remember˺ how We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who\nafflicted you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and keeping\nyour women. That was a severe test from your Lord.\nFavour 3) Parting the Sea\n50. And ˹remember˺ when We parted the sea, rescued you, and drowned\nPharaoh’s people before your very eyes.\nFavour 4) Forgiving Calf-Worship\n51. And ˹remember˺ when We appointed forty nights for Moses, then you\nworshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully. 52. Even then We\n˹still˺ forgave you so perhaps you would be grateful.\nFavour 5) Revealing the Torah\n53. And ˹remember˺ when We gave Moses the Scripture—the standard ˹to\ndistinguish between right and wrong˺ that perhaps you would be ˹rightly˺\nguided.\nFavour 6) The Way to Forgiveness\n54. And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Surely\nyou have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf, so turn in repentance\nto your Creator and execute ˹the calf-worshippers among˺ yourselves. That\nis best for you in the sight of your Creator.” Then He accepted your\nrepentance. Surely He is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.\nFavour 7) Forgiving the Demand to See Allah\n55. And ˹remember˺ when you said, “O Moses! We will never believe you\nuntil we see Allah with our own eyes,” so a thunderbolt struck you while\nyou were looking on. 56. Then We brought you back to life after your\ndeath, so that perhaps you would be grateful.\nFavour 8) Food and Shade\n57. And ˹remember when˺ We shaded you with clouds and sent down to\nyou manna and quails,[25] ˹saying˺, “Eat from the good things We have\nprovided for you.” The evildoers ˹certainly˺ did not wrong Us, but wronged\nthemselves.\n\n-- 38 of 694 --\n\nFavour 9) Permission to Enter Jerusalem\n58. And ˹remember˺ when We said, “Enter this city and eat freely from\nwherever you please; enter the gate with humility, saying, ‘Absolve us.’ We\nwill forgive your sins and multiply the reward for the good-doers.” 59. But\nthe wrongdoers changed the words they were commanded to say. So We\nsent down a punishment from the heavens upon them for their\nrebelliousness.\nFavour 10) Water for All\n60. And ˹remember˺ when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said,\n“Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out, ˹and˺\neach tribe knew its drinking place. ˹We then said,˺ “Eat and drink of Allah’s\nprovisions, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.”\nPunishment for Defiance\n61. And ˹remember˺ when you said, “O Moses! We cannot endure the same\nmeal ˹every day˺. So ˹just˺ call upon your Lord on our behalf, He will bring\nforth for us some of what the earth produces of herbs, cucumbers, garlic,\nlentils, and onions.” Moses scolded ˹them˺, “Do you exchange what is\nbetter for what is worse? ˹You can˺ go down to any village and you will find\nwhat you have asked for.” They were stricken with disgrace and misery, and\nthey invited the displeasure of Allah for rejecting Allah’s signs and unjustly\nkilling the prophets. This is ˹a fair reward˺ for their disobedience and\nviolations.\nReward of the Believers\n62. Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians[26]—whoever ˹truly˺\nbelieves in Allah and the Last Day and does good will have their reward\nwith their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.[27]\nAllah’s Covenant with the Israelites\n63. And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from you and raised the\nmountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We\nhave given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become\nmindful ˹of Allah˺.” 64. Yet you turned away afterwards. Had it not been for\nAllah’s grace and mercy upon you, you would have certainly been of the\nlosers.\nPunishment for the Sabbath-Breakers\n\n-- 39 of 694 --\n\n65. You are already aware of those of you who broke the Sabbath. We said\nto them, “Be disgraced apes!”[28] 66. So We made their fate an example to\npresent and future generations, and a lesson to the God-fearing.\nStory of the Cow\n67. And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you\nto sacrifice a cow.”[29] They replied, “Are you mocking us?” Moses\nresponded, “I seek refuge in Allah from acting foolishly!” 68. They said,\n“Call upon your Lord to clarify for us what type ˹of cow˺ it should be!” He\nreplied, “Allah says, ‘The cow should neither be old nor young but in\nbetween. So do as you are commanded!’” 69. They said, “Call upon your\nLord to specify for us its colour.” He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should be a\nbright yellow cow—pleasant to see.’” 70. Again they said, “Call upon your\nLord so that He may make clear to us which cow, for all cows look the\nsame to us. Then, Allah willing, we will be guided ˹to the right one˺.” 71.\nHe replied, “Allah says, ‘It should have been used neither to till the soil nor\nwater the fields; wholesome and without blemish.’” They said, “Now you\nhave come with the truth.” Yet they still slaughtered it hesitantly! 72. ˹This\nis˺ when a man was killed and you disputed who the killer was, but Allah\nrevealed what you concealed. 73. So We instructed, “Strike the dead body\nwith a piece of the cow.” This is how ˹easily˺ Allah brings the dead to life,\nshowing you His signs so that you may understand. 74. Even then your\nhearts became hardened like a rock or even harder, for some rocks gush\nrivers; others split, spilling water; while others are humbled in awe of\nAllah. And Allah is never unaware of what you do.\nDisobedient Israelites\n75. Do you ˹believers still˺ expect them to be true to you, though a group of\nthem would hear the word of Allah then knowingly corrupt it after\nunderstanding it? 76. When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.”\nBut in private they say ˹to each other˺, “Will you disclose to the believers\nthe knowledge Allah has revealed to you,[30] so that they may use it against\nyou before your Lord? Do you not understand?” 77. Do they not know that\nAllah is aware of what they conceal and what they reveal? 78. And among\nthem are the illiterate who know nothing about the Scripture except lies,\nand ˹so˺ they ˹wishfully˺ speculate. 79. So woe[31] to those who distort the\nScripture with their own hands then say, “This is from Allah”—seeking a\n\n-- 40 of 694 --\n\nfleeting gain! So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to\nthem for what they have earned.\nArgument and Refutation\n80. ˹Some of˺ the Jews claim, “The Fire will not touch us except for a\nnumber of days.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Have you taken a pledge from Allah—\nfor Allah never breaks His word—or are you ˹just˺ saying about Allah what\nyou do not know?” 81. But no! Those who commit evil and are engrossed\nin sin will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. 82. And\nthose who believe and do good will be the residents of Paradise. They will\nbe there forever.\nThe Israelites’ Failure to Keep Covenants\n83. And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from the children of Israel\n˹stating˺, “Worship none but Allah; be kind to parents, relatives, orphans\nand the needy; speak kindly to people; establish prayer; and pay alms-tax.”\nBut you ˹Israelites˺ turned away—except for a few of you—and were\nindifferent. 84. And ˹remember˺ when We took your covenant that you\nwould neither shed each other’s blood nor expel each other from their\nhomes, you gave your pledge and bore witness. 85. But here you are, killing\neach other and expelling some of your people from their homes, aiding one\nanother in sin and aggression; and when those ˹expelled˺ come to you as\ncaptives, you still ransom them—though expelling them was unlawful for\nyou.[32] Do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest? Is there\nany reward for those who do so among you other than disgrace in this\nworldly life and being subjected to the harshest punishment on the Day of\nJudgment? For Allah is never unaware of what you do. 86. These are the\nones who trade the Hereafter for the life of this world. So their punishment\nwill not be reduced, nor will they be helped.\nDenying Allah’s Prophets\n87. Indeed, We gave Moses the Book and sent after him successive\nmessengers. And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and supported\nhim with the holy spirit.[33] Why is it that every time a messenger comes to\nyou ˹Israelites˺ with something you do not like, you become arrogant,\nrejecting some and killing others? 88. They say, “Our hearts are\n\n-- 41 of 694 --\n\nunreceptive!”[34] In fact, Allah has condemned them for their disbelief.\nThey have but little faith.\nRejecting the Quran\n89. Although they used to pray for victory ˹by means of the Prophet˺ over\nthe polytheists,[35] when there came to them a Book from Allah which they\nrecognized,[36] confirming the Scripture they had ˹in their hands˺, they\nrejected it. So may Allah’s condemnation be upon the disbelievers. 90.\nMiserable is the price they have sold their souls for—denying Allah’s\nrevelation and resenting Allah for granting His grace to whoever He wills\nof His servants! They have earned wrath upon wrath. And such disbelievers\nwill suffer a humiliating punishment.\nExcuse for Rejecting the Quran\n91. When it is said to them: “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” they\nreply, “We only believe in what was sent down to us,” and they deny what\ncame afterwards, though it is the truth confirming their own Scriptures! Ask\n˹them, O Prophet˺, “Why then did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if you\nare ˹truly˺ believers?”\nMoses Was Defied Too\n92. Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you worshipped the\ncalf in his absence, acting wrongfully. 93. And when We took your\ncovenant and raised the mountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that\n˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and obey,” they answered, “We hear\nand disobey.” The love of the calf was rooted in their hearts because of their\ndisbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How evil is what your ˹so-called˺ belief\nprompts you to do, if you ˹actually˺ believe ˹in the Torah˺!”\nClinging to Life\n94. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter with Allah is\nexclusively for you ˹Israelites˺ out of all humanity, then wish for death if\nwhat you say is true!” 95. But they will never wish for that because of what\ntheir hands have done.[37] And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the\nwrongdoers. 96. You will surely find them clinging to life more eagerly\nthan any other people, even more than polytheists. Each one of them wishes\nto live a thousand years. But even if they were to live that long, it would not\nsave them from the punishment. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.\n\n-- 42 of 694 --\n\nRejecting the Truth\n97. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel should know that he\nrevealed this ˹Quran˺ to your heart by Allah’s Will, confirming what came\nbefore it—a guide and good news for the believers.” 98. Whoever is an\nenemy of Allah, His angels, His messengers, Gabriel, and Michael, then ˹let\nthem know that˺ Allah is certainly the enemy of the disbelievers. 99.\nIndeed, We have sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ clear revelations. ˹But˺ none\nwill deny them except the rebellious. 100. Why is it that every time they\nmake a covenant, a group of them casts it aside? In fact, most of them do\nnot believe. 101. Now, when a messenger from Allah has come to them—\nconfirming their own Scriptures—some of the People of the Book cast the\nBook of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.\nAttachment to Magic\n102. They ˹instead˺ followed the magic promoted by the devils during the\nreign of Solomon. Never did Solomon disbelieve, rather the devils\ndisbelieved. They taught magic to the people, along with what had been\nrevealed to the two angels, Hârût and Mârût, in Babylon.[38] The two angels\nnever taught anyone without saying, “We are only a test ˹for you˺, so do not\nabandon ˹your˺ faith.” Yet people learned ˹magic˺ that caused a rift ˹even˺\nbetween husband and wife; although their magic could not harm anyone\nexcept by Allah’s Will. They learned what harmed them and did not benefit\nthem—although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would\nhave no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed was the price for which\nthey sold their souls, if only they knew! 103. If only they were faithful and\nmindful ˹of Allah˺, there would have been a better reward from Allah, if\nonly they knew!\nAdvice for the Believers\n104. O believers! Do not say, “Râ’ina.” [Herd us!] But say, “Un\nẓurna,”\n[Tend to us!] and listen ˹attentively˺.[39] And the disbelievers will suffer a\npainful punishment. 105. The disbelievers from the People of the Book and\nthe polytheists would not want you to receive any blessing from your Lord,\nbut Allah selects whoever He wills for His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of\ninfinite bounty.\nObeying the Messenger\n\n-- 43 of 694 --\n\n106. If We ever abrogate[40] a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We replace it\nwith a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of\neverything? 107. Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the\nearth belongs ˹only˺ to Allah, and you have no guardian or helper besides\nAllah? 108. Or do you ˹believers˺ intend to ask of your Messenger as Moses\nwas asked before?[41] But whoever trades belief for disbelief has truly\nstrayed from the Right Way.\nAdhering to the Straight Path\n109. Many among the People of the Book wish they could turn you\n˹believers˺ back to disbelief because of their envy, after the truth has been\nmade clear to them. Pardon and bear with them until Allah delivers His\ndecision. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. 110. Establish prayer,\nand pay alms-tax. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will\n˹certainly˺ find ˹its reward˺ with Allah. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of what\nyou do.\nClaims and Refutations\n111. The Jews and Christians each claim that none will enter Paradise\nexcept those of their own faith. These are their desires. Reply, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Show ˹me˺ your proof if what you say is true.” 112. But no! Whoever\nsubmits themselves to Allah and does good will have their reward with their\nLord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. 113. The\nJews say, “The Christians have nothing to stand on” and the Christians say,\n“The Jews have nothing to stand on,” although both recite the Scriptures.\nAnd those ˹pagans˺ who have no knowledge say the same ˹about people of\nfaith˺. Surely Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment\nregarding their dispute.\nCondemning Attacks on Places of Worship\n114. Who does more wrong than those who prevent Allah’s Name from\nbeing mentioned in His places of worship and strive to destroy them? Such\npeople have no right to enter these places except with fear.[42] For them\nthere is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous\npunishment in the Hereafter. 115. To Allah belong the east and the west, so\nwherever you turn you are facing ˹towards˺ Allah.[43] Surely Allah is All-\nEncompassing,[44] All-Knowing.\n\n-- 44 of 694 --\n\nAllah is in No Need of Children\n116. They[45] say, “Allah has offspring.”[46] Glory be to Him! In fact, to\nHim belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth—all are subject to\nHis Will. 117. ˹He is˺ the Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He\ndecrees a matter, He simply tells it, “Be!” And it is!\nTrue Guidance\n118. Those who have no knowledge say, “If only Allah would speak to us\nor a sign would come to us!” The same was said by those who came before.\nTheir hearts are all alike. Indeed, We have made the signs clear for people\nof sure faith. 119. We have surely sent you with the truth ˹O Prophet˺ as a\ndeliverer of good news and a warner. And you will not be accountable for\nthe residents of the Hellfire. 120. Never will the Jews or Christians be\npleased with you, until you follow their faith. Say, “Allah’s guidance is the\nonly ˹true˺ guidance.” And if you were to follow their desires after ˹all˺ the\nknowledge that has come to you, there would be none to protect or help you\nagainst Allah. 121. Those We have given the Book follow it as it should be\nfollowed. It is they who ˹truly˺ believe in it. As for those who reject it, it is\nthey who are the losers.\nReminder of Favours upon the Israelites\n122. O Children of Israel! Remember My favours upon you and how I\nhonoured you above the others. 123. And guard yourselves against the Day\nwhen no soul will be of any help to another. No ransom will be taken, no\nintercession accepted, and no help will be given.\nAbraham in Mecca\n124. ˹Remember˺ when Abraham was tested by his Lord with ˹certain˺\ncommandments, which he fulfilled. Allah said, “I will certainly make you\ninto a role model for the people.” Abraham asked, “What about my\noffspring?” Allah replied, “My covenant is not extended to the\nwrongdoers.” 125. And ˹remember˺ when We made the Sacred House[47] a\ncentre and a sanctuary for the people ˹saying˺, “˹You may˺ take the\nstanding-place of Abraham[48] as a site of prayer.” And We entrusted\nAbraham and Ishmael to purify My House for those who circle it, who\nmeditate in it, and who bow and prostrate themselves ˹in prayer˺.\nAbraham’s Prayers\n\n-- 45 of 694 --\n\n126. And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city ˹of\nMecca˺ secure and provide fruits to its people—those among them who\nbelieve in Allah and the Last Day.” He answered, “As for those who\ndisbelieve, I will let them enjoy themselves for a little while, then I will\ncondemn them to the torment of the Fire. What an evil destination!”\nRaising the Foundation of the Sacred House\n127. And ˹remember˺ when Abraham raised the foundation of the House\nwith Ishmael, ˹both praying,˺ “Our Lord! Accept ˹this˺ from us. You are\nindeed the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 128. Our Lord! Make us both ˹fully˺\nsubmit to You[49] and from our descendants a nation that will submit to you.\nShow us our rituals, and turn to us in grace. You are truly the Accepter of\nRepentance, Most Merciful. 129. Our Lord! Raise from among them a\nmessenger who will recite to them Your revelations, teach them the Book\nand wisdom, and purify them. Indeed, You ˹alone˺ are the Almighty, All-\nWise.”\nOne God\n130. And who would reject the faith of Abraham except a fool! We\ncertainly chose him in this life, and in the Hereafter he will surely be among\nthe righteous. 131. When his Lord ordered him, “Submit ˹to My Will˺,” he\nresponded, “I submit to the Lord of all worlds.” 132. This was the advice of\nAbraham—as well as Jacob—to his children, ˹saying˺, “Indeed, Allah has\nchosen for you this faith; so do not die except in ˹a state of full˺\nsubmission.” 133. Or did you witness when death came to Jacob? He asked\nhis children, “Who will you worship after my passing?” They replied, “We\nwill ˹continue to˺ worship your God, the God of your forefathers—\nAbraham, Ishmael, and Isaac—the One God. And to Him we ˹all˺ submit.”\n134. That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what\nthey earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be\naccountable for what they have done.\nProphets of Islam\n135. The Jews and Christians each say, “Follow our faith to be ˹rightly˺\nguided.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “No! We follow the faith of Abraham, the\nupright—who was not a polytheist.” 136. Say, ˹O believers,˺ “We believe in\nAllah and what has been revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham,\nIshmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses,\n\n-- 46 of 694 --\n\nJesus, and other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between\nany of them. And to Allah we all submit.” 137. So if they believe in what\nyou believe, then they will indeed be ˹rightly˺ guided. But if they turn away,\nthey are simply opposed ˹to the truth˺. But Allah will spare you their evil.\nFor He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\nMany Messengers; One Message\n138. This is the ˹natural˺ Way of Allah. And who is better than Allah in\nordaining a way? And we worship ˹none but˺ Him. 139. Say, “Would you\ndispute with us about Allah, while He is our Lord and your Lord? We are\naccountable for our deeds and you for yours. And we are devoted to Him\n˹alone˺. 140. Or do you claim that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his\ndescendants were all Jews or Christians?” Say, “Who is more\nknowledgeable: you or Allah?” Who does more wrong than those who hide\nthe testimony they received from Allah? And Allah is never unaware of\nwhat you do. 141. That was a community that had already gone before. For\nthem is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you\nwill not be accountable for what they have done.\nNew Direction of Prayer\n142. The foolish among the people will ask, “Why did they turn away from\nthe direction of prayer they used to face?”[50] Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The east\nand west belong ˹only˺ to Allah. He guides whoever He wills to the Straight\nPath.” 143. And so We have made you ˹believers˺ an upright[51] community\nso that you may be witnesses over humanity and that the Messenger may be\na witness over you. We assigned your former direction of prayer only to\ndistinguish those who would remain faithful to the Messenger from those\nwho would lose faith. It was certainly a difficult test except for those\n˹rightly˺ guided by Allah. And Allah would never discount your ˹previous\nacts of˺ faith. Surely Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity.\nOrder to Face Mecca in Prayer\n144. Indeed, We see you ˹O Prophet˺ turning your face towards heaven.\nNow We will make you turn towards a direction ˹of prayer˺ that will please\nyou. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque ˹in Mecca˺—wherever\nyou are, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Scripture\ncertainly know this to be the truth from their Lord. And Allah is never\n\n-- 47 of 694 --\n\nunaware of what they do. 145. Even if you were to bring every proof to the\nPeople of the Book, they would not accept your direction ˹of prayer˺, nor\nwould you accept theirs; nor would any of them accept the direction ˹of\nprayer˺ of another. And if you were to follow their desires after ˹all˺ the\nknowledge that has come to you, then you would certainly be one of the\nwrongdoers.\nThe Truth About the Prophet\n146. Those We have given the Scripture recognize this ˹Prophet˺ as they\nrecognize their own children. Yet a group of them hides the truth\nknowingly. 147. ˹This is˺ the truth from your Lord, so do not ever be one of\nthose who doubt. 148. Everyone turns to their own direction ˹of prayer˺. So\ncompete with one another in doing good. Wherever you are, Allah will\nbring you all together ˹for judgment˺. Surely Allah is Most Capable of\neverything.\nOrder to Face the Sacred Mosque\n149. Wherever you are ˹O Prophet˺, turn your face towards the Sacred\nMosque. This is certainly the truth from your Lord. And Allah is never\nunaware of what you ˹all˺ do. 150. Wherever you are ˹O Prophet˺, turn your\nface towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you ˹believers˺ are, face\ntowards it, so that people will have no argument against you, except the\nwrongdoers among them. Do not fear them; fear Me, so that I may\n˹continue to˺ perfect My favour upon you and so you may be ˹rightly˺\nguided.\nAllah’s Favour upon the Believers\n151. Since We have sent you a messenger from among yourselves—reciting\nto you Our revelations, purifying you, teaching you the Book and wisdom,\nand teaching you what you never knew— 152. remember Me; I will\nremember you. And thank Me, and never be ungrateful.\nPatience in Difficult Times\n153. O believers! Seek comfort in patience and prayer. Allah is truly with\nthose who are patient. 154. Never say that those martyred in the cause of\nAllah are dead—in fact, they are alive! But you do not perceive it. 155. We\nwill certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property,\nlife, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endure— 156. who,\n\n-- 48 of 694 --\n\nwhen faced with a disaster, say, “Surely to Allah we belong and to Him we\nwill ˹all˺ return.” 157. They are the ones who will receive Allah’s blessings\nand mercy. And it is they who are ˹rightly˺ guided.\nA Pilgrimage Ritual\n158. Indeed, ˹the hills of˺\nṢafa and Marwah[52] are among the symbols of\nAllah. So whoever performs the pilgrimage or minor pilgrimage,[53] let\nthem walk between ˹the two hills˺. And whoever does good willingly, Allah\nis truly Appreciative, All-Knowing.\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n159. Those who hide the clear proofs and guidance that We have revealed—\nafter We made it clear for humanity in the Book—will be condemned by\nAllah and ˹all˺ those who condemn. 160. As for those who repent, mend\ntheir ways, and let the truth be known, they are the ones to whom I will turn\n˹in forgiveness˺, for I am the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. 161.\nSurely those who disbelieve and die as disbelievers are condemned by\nAllah, the angels, and all of humanity. 162. They will be in Hell forever.\nTheir punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be delayed ˹from it˺.\nAllah’s Great Signs\n163. Your God is ˹only˺ One God. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺\nexcept Him—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful. 164. Indeed, in the\ncreation of the heavens and the earth; the alternation of the day and the\nnight; the ships that sail the sea for the benefit of humanity; the rain sent\ndown by Allah from the skies, reviving the earth after its death; the\nscattering of all kinds of creatures throughout; the shifting of the winds; and\nthe clouds drifting between the heavens and the earth—˹in all of this˺ are\nsurely signs for people of understanding.\nAssociating Others with Allah\n165. Still there are some who take others as Allah’s equal—they love them\nas they should love Allah—but the ˹true˺ believers love Allah even more. If\nonly the wrongdoers could see the ˹horrible˺ punishment ˹awaiting them˺,\nthey would certainly realize that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah\nis indeed severe in punishment.\nLosers Disowning Each Other\n\n-- 49 of 694 --\n\n166. ˹Consider the Day˺ when those who misled others will disown their\nfollowers—when they face the torment—and the bonds that united them\nwill be cut off. 167. The ˹misled˺ followers will cry, “If only we could have\na second chance, we would disown them as they disowned us.” And so\nAllah will make them remorseful of their misdeeds. And they will never ˹be\nable to˺ leave the Fire.\nWarning Against Satan\n168. O humanity! Eat from what is lawful and good on the earth and do not\nfollow Satan’s footsteps. He is truly your sworn enemy. 169. He only incites\nyou to commit evil and indecency, and to claim against Allah what you do\nnot know.\nBlind Following\n170. When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” they reply,\n“No! We ˹only˺ follow what we found our forefathers practicing.” ˹Would\nthey still do so,˺ even if their forefathers had ˹absolutely˺ no understanding\nor guidance?\nExample of the Disbelievers\n171. The example of the disbelievers ˹not responding to the Messenger’s\nwarning˺ is like a flock not comprehending the calls and cries of the\nshepherd. ˹They are wilfully˺ deaf, dumb and blind so they have no\nunderstanding.\nForbidden Foods\n172. O believers! Eat from the good things We have provided for you. And\ngive thanks to Allah if you ˹truly˺ worship Him ˹alone˺. 173. He has only\nforbidden you ˹to eat˺ carrion, blood, swine,[54] and what is slaughtered in\nthe name of any other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity\n—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need—they will not be\nsinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nHiding the Truth\n174. Indeed, those who hide Allah’s revelations, trading them for a fleeting\ngain consume nothing but fire into their bellies. Allah will neither speak to\nthem on the Day of Judgment, nor will He purify them. And they will suffer\na painful punishment. 175. They are the ones who trade guidance for\nmisguidance and forgiveness for punishment. How persistent are they in\n\n-- 50 of 694 --\n\npursuit of the Fire! 176. That is because Allah has revealed the Book in\ntruth. And surely those who differ regarding it are totally engrossed in\nopposition.\nTrue Righteousness\n177. Righteousness is not in turning your faces towards the east or the west.\nRather, the righteous are those who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the\nangels, the Books, and the prophets; who give charity out of their cherished\nwealth to relatives, orphans, the poor, ˹needy˺ travellers, beggars, and for\nfreeing captives; who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and keep the pledges\nthey make; and who are patient in times of suffering, adversity, and in ˹the\nheat of˺ battle. It is they who are true ˹in faith˺, and it is they who are\nmindful ˹of Allah˺.\nLaw of Retaliation[55]\n178. O believers! ˹The law of˺ retaliation is set for you in cases of murder—\na free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female.[56]\nBut if the offender is pardoned by the victim’s guardian,[57] then blood-\nmoney should be decided fairly[58] and payment should be made\ncourteously. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever\ntransgresses after that will suffer a painful punishment. 179. There is\n˹security of˺ life for you in ˹the law of˺ retaliation, O people of reason, so\nthat you may become mindful ˹of Allah˺.\nLast Will and Bequests\n180. It is prescribed that when death approaches any of you—if they leave\nsomething of value—a will should be made in favour of parents and\nimmediate family with fairness.[59] ˹This is˺ an obligation on those who are\nmindful ˹of Allah˺. 181. But whoever changes the will after hearing it,[60]\nthe blame will only be on those who made the change. Indeed, Allah is All-\nHearing, All-Knowing. 182. Whoever suspects an error or an injustice in\nthe will and brings about a ˹fair˺ settlement among the parties will not be\nsinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nRules of Fasting\n183. O believers! Fasting is prescribed for you—as it was for those before\nyou[61]—so perhaps you will become mindful ˹of Allah˺. 184. ˹Fast a˺\nprescribed number of days.[62] But whoever of you is ill or on a journey,\n\n-- 51 of 694 --\n\nthen ˹let them fast˺ an equal number of days ˹after Ramaḍân˺. For those\nwho can only fast with extreme difficulty,[63] compensation can be made by\nfeeding a needy person ˹for every day not fasted˺. But whoever volunteers\nto give more, it is better for them. And to fast is better for you, if only you\nknew.\nExcellence of Ramaḍân\n185. Ramaḍân is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for\nhumanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard ˹to distinguish\nbetween right and wrong˺. So whoever is present this month, let them fast.\nBut whoever is ill or on a journey, then ˹let them fast˺ an equal number of\ndays ˹after Ramaḍân˺. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you\nmay complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for\nguiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful.\nAllah Is Always Near\n186. When My servants ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about Me: I am truly near. I\nrespond to one’s prayer when they call upon Me. So let them respond ˹with\nobedience˺ to Me and believe in Me, perhaps they will be guided ˹to the\nRight Way˺.\nIntimacy During the Nights of Rama\nḍân\n187. It has been made permissible for you to be intimate with your wives\nduring the nights preceding the fast. Your spouses are a garment[64] for you\nas you are for them. Allah knows that you were deceiving yourselves.[65] So\nHe has accepted your repentance and pardoned you. So now you may be\nintimate with them and seek what Allah has prescribed for you.[66] ˹You\nmay˺ eat and drink until you see the light of dawn breaking the darkness of\nnight, then complete the fast until nightfall. Do not be intimate with your\nspouses while you are meditating in the mosques. These are the limits set\nby Allah, so do not exceed them. This is how Allah makes His revelations\nclear to people, so they may become mindful ˹of Him˺.\nWarning Against Injustice\n188. Do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly, nor deliberately bribe\nauthorities in order to devour a portion of others’ property, knowing that it\nis a sin.\nTrue Righteousness\n\n-- 52 of 694 --\n\n189. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the phases of the moon. Say, “They\nare a means for people to determine time and pilgrimage.” Righteousness is\nnot in entering your houses from the back doors.[67] Rather, righteousness is\nto be mindful ˹of Allah˺. So enter your homes through their ˹proper˺ doors,\nand be mindful of Allah so you may be successful.\nEtiquette of Fighting Enemy Combatants\n190. Fight in the cause of Allah ˹only˺ against those who wage war against\nyou, but do not exceed the limits.[68] Surely Allah does not like\ntransgressors. 191. Kill them wherever you come upon them[69] and drive\nthem out of the places from which they have driven you out. For\npersecution[70] is far worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred\nMosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight them—that is\nthe reward of the disbelievers. 192. But if they cease, then surely Allah is\nAll-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nResisting Oppression\n193. Fight against them ˹if they persecute you˺ until there is no more\npersecution, and ˹your˺ devotion will be to Allah ˹alone˺. If they stop\n˹persecuting you˺, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors.\n194. ˹There will be retaliation in˺ a sacred month for ˹an offence in˺ a sacred\nmonth,[71] and all violations will bring about retaliation. So, if anyone\nattacks you, retaliate in the same manner. ˹But˺ be mindful of Allah, and\nknow that Allah is with those mindful ˹of Him˺. 195. Spend in the cause of\nAllah and do not let your own hands throw you into destruction ˹by\nwithholding˺. And do good, for Allah certainly loves the good-doers.\nSome Pilgrimage Rituals\n196. Complete the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage for Allah.[72] But if\nprevented ˹from proceeding˺, then ˹offer˺ whatever sacrificial animals you\ncan afford. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal reaches\nits destination. But if any of you is ill or has a scalp ailment ˹requiring\nshaving˺, then compensate either by fasting, charity, or a sacrificial offering.\nIn times of peace, you may combine the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage\nthen make the sacrificial offering you can afford. Whoever cannot afford\nthat ˹offering˺, let them fast three days during pilgrimage and seven after\nreturning ˹home˺—completing ten. These offerings are for those who do not\n\n-- 53 of 694 --\n\nlive near the Sacred House. And be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah\nis severe in punishment.\nMore Pilgrimage Rituals\n197. ˹Commitment to˺ pilgrimage is made in appointed months.[73]\nWhoever commits to ˹performing˺ pilgrimage, let them stay away from\nintimate relations, foul language, and arguments during pilgrimage.\nWhatever good you do, Allah ˹fully˺ knows of it. Take ˹necessary˺\nprovisions ˹for the journey˺—surely the best provision is righteousness.\nAnd be mindful of Me, O people of reason! 198. There is no blame on you\nfor seeking the bounty of your Lord ˹during this journey˺.[74] When you\nreturn from ’Arafât,[75] praise Allah near the sacred place[76] and praise\nHim for having guided you, for surely before this ˹guidance˺ you were\nastray. 199. Then go forth with the rest of the pilgrims. And seek Allah’s\nforgiveness. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nPraying for the Best of Both Worlds\n200. When you have fulfilled your sacred rites, praise Allah as you used to\npraise your forefathers ˹before Islam˺, or even more passionately. There are\nsome who say, “Our Lord! Grant us ˹Your bounties˺ in this world,” but they\nwill have no share in the Hereafter. 201. Yet there are others who say, “Our\nLord! Grant us the good of this world and the Hereafter, and protect us from\nthe torment of the Fire.” 202. It is they who will receive a ˹heavenly˺ reward\nfor the good they have done. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.[77]\nMore Pilgrimage Rituals\n203. And remember Allah during ˹these˺ appointed days.[78] Whoever\ndeparts swiftly on the second day is not sinful, neither are those who stay\nbehind ˹till the third—seeking additional reward˺, so long as they are\nmindful ˹of their Lord˺. And be mindful of Allah, and know that to Him you\nwill ˹all˺ be gathered.\nThose Who Spread Mischief\n204. There are some ˹hypocrites˺ who impress you with their views\nregarding worldly affairs and openly call upon Allah to witness what is in\ntheir hearts, yet they are your worst adversaries. 205. And when they leave\n˹you˺,[79] they strive throughout the land to spread mischief in it and destroy\ncrops and cattle. Allah does not like mischief. 206. When it is said to them,\n\n-- 54 of 694 --\n\n“Fear Allah,” pride carries them off to sin. Hell will be their proper place.\nWhat an evil place to rest! 207. And there are those who would dedicate\ntheir lives to Allah’s pleasure. And Allah is Ever Gracious to ˹His˺ servants.\nWarning Against the Devil\n208. O believers! Enter into Islam wholeheartedly and do not follow Satan’s\nfootsteps. Surely he is your sworn enemy. 209. If you falter after receiving\nthe clear proofs, then know that Allah is indeed Almighty, All-Wise.\nWaiting for Judgment?\n210. Are they waiting for Allah ˹Himself˺ to come to them in the shade of\nclouds, along with the angels? ˹If He did˺, then the matter would be settled\n˹at once˺. And to Allah ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺. 211.\nAsk the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them. And\nwhoever trades Allah’s favour—after receiving it—˹for disbelief˺ should\nknow that Allah is indeed severe in punishment.\nLife as a Test\n212. The life of this world has been made appealing to the disbelievers, and\nthey mock the believers. Those who are mindful ˹of Allah˺ will rank above\nthem on the Day of Judgment. And Allah provides for whoever He wills\nwithout limit.\nWhy Prophets Were Sent\n213. Humanity had once been one community ˹of believers before they lost\nfaith˺. Then Allah raised prophets as deliverers of good news and as\nwarners, and revealed to them the Scriptures in truth to judge among people\nregarding their disputes. And no one disputed the Scriptures except the very\npeople who received them after clear proofs had come to them—out of\njealousy. Then Allah, by His grace, has guided the believers to the truth\nregarding those disputes. And Allah guides whoever He wills to the Straight\nPath.\nFaith Reinforced by Affliction\n214. Do you think you will be admitted into Paradise without being tested\nlike those before you? They were afflicted with suffering and adversity and\nwere so ˹violently˺ shaken that ˹even˺ the Messenger and the believers with\nhim cried out, “When will Allah’s help come?” Indeed, Allah’s help is\n˹always˺ near.\n\n-- 55 of 694 --\n\nCharity Begins at Home\n215. They ask you ˹O Prophet in˺ what ˹way˺ they should donate. Say,\n“Whatever donations you give are for parents, relatives, orphans, the poor,\nand ˹needy˺ travellers. Whatever good you do is certainly well known to\nAllah.”\nFighting in Self-Defence\n216. Fighting has been made obligatory upon you ˹believers˺, though you\ndislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like\nsomething which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.\nFighting in the Sacred Months\n217. They[80] ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about fighting in the sacred months.[81]\nSay, “Fighting during these months is a great sin. But hindering ˹others˺\nfrom the Path of Allah, rejecting Him, and expelling the worshippers from\nthe Sacred Mosque is ˹a˺ greater ˹sin˺ in the sight of Allah. For\npersecution[82] is far worse than killing. And they will not stop fighting you\nuntil they turn you away from your faith—if they can. And whoever among\nyou renounces their own faith and dies a disbeliever, their deeds will\nbecome void in this life and in the Hereafter. It is they who will be the\nresidents of the Fire. They will be there forever.”[83]\nReward of the Devout\n218. Surely those who have believed, emigrated, and struggled in the Way\nof Allah—they can hope for Allah’s mercy. And Allah is All-Forgiving,\nMost Merciful.\nQuestions to the Prophet\n219. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about intoxicants and gambling. Say, “There\nis great evil in both, as well as some benefit for people—but the evil\noutweighs the benefit.”[84] They ˹also˺ ask you what they should donate.\nSay, “Whatever you can spare.” This is how Allah makes His revelations\nclear to you ˹believers˺, so perhaps you may reflect 220. upon this world\nand the Hereafter. And they ask you concerning orphans. Say, “Improving\ntheir condition is best. And if you partner with them, they are bonded with\nyou ˹in faith˺.[85] And Allah knows who intends harm and who intends\ngood. Had Allah willed, He could have made it difficult for you.[86] Surely\nAllah is Almighty, All-Wise.”\n\n-- 56 of 694 --\n\nMarrying Believers\n221. Do not marry polytheistic women until they believe; for a believing\nslave-woman is better than a free polytheist, even though she may look\npleasant to you. And do not marry your women to polytheistic men until\nthey believe, for a believing slave-man is better than a free polytheist, even\nthough he may look pleasant to you. They invite ˹you˺ to the Fire while\nAllah invites ˹you˺ to Paradise and forgiveness by His grace.[87] He makes\nHis revelations clear to the people so perhaps they will be mindful.\nIntercourse During Menstruation\n222. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about menstruation. Say, “Beware of its\nharm! So keep away, and do not have intercourse with your wives during\ntheir monthly cycles until they are purified.[88] When they purify\nthemselves, then you may approach them in the manner specified by Allah.\nSurely Allah loves those who always turn to Him in repentance and those\nwho purify themselves.” 223. Your wives are like farmland for you,[89] so\napproach them ˹consensually˺ as you please.[90] And send forth something\ngood for yourselves.[91] Be mindful of Allah, and know that you will meet\nHim. And give good news to the believers.\nRules Regarding Oaths\n224. Do not use Allah’s Name in your oaths as an excuse for not doing\ngood, not guarding against evil, or not making peace between people. And\nAllah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 225. Allah will not hold you\naccountable for unintentional oaths, but for what you intended in your\nhearts. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.\nVowing Not to Touch One’s Own Wife\n226. Those who swear not to have intercourse with their wives must wait\nfor four months.[92] If they change their mind, then Allah is certainly All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful. 227. But if they settle on divorce, then Allah is\nindeed All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\nWaiting Period After Divorce\n228. Divorced women must wait three monthly cycles ˹before they can re-\nmarry˺. It is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their\nwombs,[93] if they ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their\nhusbands reserve the right to take them back within that period if they\n\n-- 57 of 694 --\n\ndesire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those of men equitably,\nalthough men have a degree ˹of responsibility˺ above them. And Allah is\nAlmighty, All-Wise.\nProper Way to Divorce\n229. Divorce may be retracted twice, then the husband must retain ˹his\nwife˺ with honour or separate ˹from her˺ with grace.[94] It is not lawful for\nhusbands to take back anything of the dowry given to their wives, unless\nthe couple fears not being able to keep within the limits of Allah.[95] So if\nyou fear they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah, there is no\nblame if the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce.[96] These are\nthe limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses\nthe limits of Allah, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.\nHusband Remarrying His Ex-Wife\n230. So if a husband divorces his wife ˹three times˺, then it is not lawful for\nhim to remarry her until after she has married another man and then is\ndivorced. Then it is permissible for them to reunite, as long as they feel they\nare able to maintain the limits of Allah. These are the limits set by Allah,\nwhich He makes clear for people of knowledge.\nEtiquette of Divorce\n231. When you divorce women and they have ˹almost˺ reached the end of\ntheir waiting period, either retain them honourably or let them go\nhonourably. But do not retain them ˹only˺ to harm them ˹or˺ to take\nadvantage ˹of them˺. Whoever does that surely wrongs his own soul. Do not\ntake Allah’s revelations lightly. Remember Allah’s favours upon you as\nwell as the Book and wisdom[97] He has sent down for your guidance. Be\nmindful of Allah, and know that Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.\nRemarrying One’s Ex-Spouse\n232. When you have divorced women and they have reached the end of\ntheir waiting period, do not prevent them from re-marrying their ex-\nhusbands if they come to an honourable agreement. This is enjoined on\nwhoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. This is purer and more\ndignifying for you. Allah knows and you do not know.\nNursing Children After Divorce\n\n-- 58 of 694 --\n\n233. ˹Divorced˺ mothers will breastfeed their offspring for two whole years,\nfor those who wish to complete the nursing ˹of their child˺. The child’s\nfather will provide reasonable maintenance and clothing for the mother\n˹during that period˺. No one will be charged with more than they can bear.\nNo mother or father should be made to suffer for their child. The ˹father’s˺\nheirs are under the same obligation. But if both sides decide—after mutual\nconsultation and consent—to wean a child, then there is no blame on them.\nAnd if you decide to have your children nursed by a wet-nurse, it is\npermissible as long as you pay fairly. Be mindful of Allah, and know that\nAllah is All-Seeing of what you do.\nWidows’ Waiting Period\n234. As for those of you who die and leave widows behind, let them\nobserve a waiting period of four months and ten days. When they have\nreached the end of this period, then you[98] are not accountable for what\nthey decide for themselves in a reasonable manner. And Allah is All-Aware\nof what you do.\nProposing to Widowed or Divorced Women\n235. There is no blame on you for subtly showing interest in ˹divorced or\nwidowed˺ women[99] or for hiding ˹the intention˺ in your hearts. Allah\nknows that you are considering them ˹for marriage˺. But do not make a\nsecret commitment with them—you can only show interest in them\nappropriately. Do not commit to the bond of marriage until the waiting\nperiod expires. Know that Allah is aware of what is in your hearts, so\nbeware of Him. And know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.\nDivorce Before Consummation\n236. There is no blame if you divorce women before the marriage is\nconsummated or the dowry is settled. But give them a ˹suitable˺\ncompensation—the rich according to his means and the poor according to\nhis. A reasonable compensation is an obligation on the good-doers. 237.\nAnd if you divorce them before consummating the marriage but after\ndeciding on a dowry, pay half of the dowry, unless the wife graciously\nwaives it or the husband graciously pays in full. Graciousness is closer to\nrighteousness. And do not forget kindness among yourselves. Surely Allah\nis All-Seeing of what you do.\n\n-- 59 of 694 --\n\nObserving Prayers[100]\n238. Observe the ˹five obligatory˺ prayers—especially the middle\nprayer[101]—and stand in true devotion to Allah. 239. If you are in danger,\npray on foot or while riding. But when you are safe, ˹take time to˺\nremember Allah for teaching you what you did not know.\nWidows’ Original Waiting Period\n240. Those of you who die leaving widows should bequeath for them a\nyear’s maintenance without forcing them out.[102] But if they choose to\nleave, you are not accountable for what they reasonably decide for\nthemselves. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.\nCare for Divorced Women\n241. Reasonable provisions must be made for divorced women—a duty on\nthose mindful ˹of Allah˺. 242. This is how Allah makes His revelations\nclear to you, so perhaps you will understand.\nSacrifices in Allah’s Cause\n243. Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who fled their homes in the\nthousands for fear of death?[103] Allah said to them, “Die!” then He gave\nthem life. Surely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most people are\nungrateful. 244. Fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah is All-\nHearing, All-Knowing. 245. Who will lend to Allah a good loan which\nAllah will multiply many times over? It is Allah ˹alone˺ who decreases and\nincreases ˹wealth˺. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.\nProphet Samuel\n246. Have you not seen those chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses?\nThey said to one of their prophets, “Appoint for us a king, ˹and˺ we will\nfight in the cause of Allah.” He said, “Are you not going to cower if ordered\nto fight?” They replied, “How could we refuse to fight in the cause of\nAllah, while we were driven out of our homes and ˹separated from˺ our\nchildren?” But when they were ordered to fight, they fled, except for a few\nof them. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers.\nKing Saul\n247. Their prophet told them, “Allah has appointed Saul[104] to be your\nking.” They protested, “How can he be our king when some of us are more\ndeserving of kingship than he, and he has not been blessed with vast\n\n-- 60 of 694 --\n\nriches?” He replied, “Allah has chosen him over you and blessed him with\nknowledge and stature. Allah grants kingship to whoever He wills. And\nAllah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.” 248. Their prophet further told them,\n“The sign of Saul’s kingship is that the Ark will come to you—containing\nreassurance[105] from your Lord and relics of the family of Moses and the\nfamily of Aaron,[106] which will be carried by the angels. Surely in this is a\nsign for you, if you ˹truly˺ believe.”\nSaul’s Victory\n249. When Saul marched forth with his army, he cautioned: “Allah will test\nyou with a river. So whoever drinks ˹his fill˺ from it is not with me, and\nwhoever does not taste it—except a sip from the hollow of his hands—is\ndefinitely with me.” They all drank ˹their fill˺ except for a few! When he\nand the ˹remaining˺ faithful with him crossed the river, they said, “Now we\nare no match for Goliath and his warriors.” But those ˹believers˺ who were\ncertain they would meet Allah reasoned, “How many times has a small\nforce vanquished a mighty army by the Will of Allah! And Allah is ˹always˺\nwith the steadfast.”\nDavid Kills Goliath\n250. When they advanced to face Goliath and his warriors, they prayed,\n“Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, make our steps firm, and give us\nvictory over the disbelieving people.” 251. So they defeated them by\nAllah’s Will, and David killed Goliath. And Allah blessed David with\nkingship and wisdom and taught him what He willed. Had Allah not\nrepelled a group of people by ˹the might of˺ another, corruption would have\ndominated the earth, but Allah is Gracious to all. 252. These are Allah’s\nrevelations which We recite to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth. And you are truly\none of the messengers.\nSome Messengers Raised in Rank\n253. We have chosen some of those messengers above others.[107] Allah\nspoke directly to some, and raised some high in rank. To Jesus, son of Mary,\nWe gave clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit.[108] If Allah\nhad willed, succeeding generations would not have fought ˹among\nthemselves˺ after receiving the clear proofs. But they differed—some\n\n-- 61 of 694 --\n\nbelieved while others disbelieved. Yet if Allah had willed, they would not\nhave fought one another. But Allah does what He wills.\nSpending in Allah’s Way\n254. O believers! Donate from what We have provided for you before the\narrival of a Day when there will be no bargaining,[109] friendship,[110] or\nintercession. Those who disbelieve are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers.\nOne True God\n255. Allah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Ever-\nLiving, All-Sustaining. Neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes Him. To\nHim belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who\ncould possibly intercede with Him without His permission? He ˹fully˺\nknows what is ahead of them and what is behind them, but no one can grasp\nany of His knowledge—except what He wills ˹to reveal˺. His Seat[111]\nencompasses the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of both does\nnot tire Him. For He is the Most High, the Greatest.[112]\nFree Will in Accepting Islam\n256. Let there be no compulsion in religion, for the truth stands out clearly\nfrom falsehood.[113] So whoever renounces false gods and believes in Allah\nhas certainly grasped the firmest, unfailing hand-hold. And Allah is All-\nHearing, All-Knowing. 257. Allah is the Guardian of the believers—He\nbrings them out of darkness and into light. As for the disbelievers, their\nguardians are false gods who lead them out of light and into darkness. It is\nthey who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.\nAbraham and the Arrogant King\n258. Are you ˹O Prophet˺ not aware of the one who argued with Abraham\nabout his Lord because Allah had granted him kingship? ˹Remember˺ when\nAbraham said, “My Lord is the One Who has power to give life and cause\ndeath.” He argued, “I too have the power to give life and cause death.”\nAbraham challenged ˹him˺, “Allah causes the sun to rise from the east. So\nmake it rise from the west.” And so the disbeliever was dumbstruck. And\nAllah does not guide the wrongdoing people.\nStory of Ezra\n259. Or ˹are you not aware of˺ the one who passed by a city which was in\nruins. He wondered, “How could Allah bring this back to life after its\n\n-- 62 of 694 --\n\ndestruction?” So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years then brought\nhim back to life. Allah asked, “How long have you remained ˹in this\nstate˺?” He replied, “Perhaps a day or part of a day.” Allah said, “No! You\nhave remained here for a hundred years! Just look at your food and drink—\nthey have not spoiled. ˹But now˺ look at ˹the remains of˺ your donkey! And\n˹so˺ We have made you into a sign for humanity. And look at the bones ˹of\nthe donkey˺, how We bring them together then clothe them with flesh!”[114]\nWhen this was made clear to him, he declared, “˹Now˺ I know that Allah is\nMost Capable of everything.”\nAbraham Inquiring About Resurrection\n260. And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord! Show me how you\ngive life to the dead.” Allah responded, “Do you not believe?” Abraham\nreplied, “Yes I do, but just so my heart can be reassured.” Allah said, “Then\nbring four birds, train them to come to you, ˹then cut them into pieces,˺ and\nscatter them on different hilltops. Then call them back, they will fly to you\nin haste. And ˹so you will˺ know that Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.”\nMultiplied Rewards for Charity\n261. The example of those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah is\nthat of a grain that sprouts into seven ears, each bearing one hundred grains.\nAnd Allah multiplies ˹the reward even more˺ to whoever He wills. For\nAllah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.\nSincere Charity\n262. Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah and do not follow\ntheir charity with reminders of their generosity or hurtful words—they will\nget their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will\nthey grieve. 263. Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity\nfollowed by injury. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing.\nParable for Wasted Charity\n264. O believers! Do not waste your charity with reminders ˹of your\ngenerosity˺ or hurtful words, like those who donate their wealth just to show\noff and do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. Their example is that of a\nhard barren rock covered with a thin layer of soil hit by a strong rain—\nleaving it just a bare stone. Such people are unable to preserve the reward of\ntheir charity. Allah does not guide ˹such˺ disbelieving people.\n\n-- 63 of 694 --\n\nParable for Accepted Charity\n265. And the example of those who donate their wealth, seeking Allah’s\npleasure and believing the reward is certain,[115] is that of a garden on a\nfertile hill: when heavy rain falls, it yields up twice its normal produce. If\nno heavy rain falls, a drizzle is sufficient. And Allah is All-Seeing of what\nyou do.\nWasted Reward\n266. Would any of you wish to have a garden with palm trees, grapevines,\nand all kinds of fruits with rivers flowing underneath and as they grow very\nold with dependent children, a fiery whirlwind hits the garden, burning it all\nup? This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you\nwill reflect.\nQuality Charity\n267. O believers! Donate from the best of what you have earned and of\nwhat We have produced for you from the earth. Do not pick out worthless\nthings for donation, which you yourselves would only accept with closed\neyes. And know that Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.\nDevil Discouraging Charity\n268. The Devil threatens you with ˹the prospect of˺ poverty and bids you to\nthe shameful deed ˹of stinginess˺, while Allah promises you forgiveness and\n˹great˺ bounties from Him. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.\nWisdom as a Privilege, Not a Right\n269. Allah grants wisdom to whoever He wills. And whoever is granted\nwisdom is certainly blessed with a great privilege. But none will be mindful\n˹of this˺ except people of reason.\nDonating Openly and Secretly\n270. Whatever charities you give or vows you make are surely known to\nAllah. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers. 271. To give charity\npublicly is good, but to give to the poor privately is better for you, and will\nabsolve you of your sins. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.[116] 272.\nYou are not responsible for people’s guidance ˹O Prophet˺—it is Allah Who\nguides whoever He wills. Whatever you ˹believers˺ spend in charity, it is for\nyour own good—as long as you do so seeking the pleasure of Allah.[117]\n\n-- 64 of 694 --\n\nWhatever you donate will be paid back to you in full, and you will not be\nwronged.\nCaring for the Needy\n273. ˹Charity is˺ for the needy who are too engaged in the cause of Allah to\nmove about in the land ˹for work˺. Those unfamiliar with their situation will\nthink they are not in need ˹of charity˺ because they do not beg. You can\nrecognize them by their appearance. They do not beg people persistently.\nWhatever you give in charity is certainly well known to Allah. 274. Those\nwho spend their wealth in charity day and night, secretly and openly—their\nreward is with their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they\ngrieve.\nInterest Prohibited\n275. Those who consume interest will stand ˹on Judgment Day˺ like those\ndriven to madness by Satan’s touch. That is because they say, “Trade is no\ndifferent than interest.” But Allah has permitted trading and forbidden\ninterest. Whoever refrains—after having received warning from their Lord\n—may keep their previous gains, and their case is left to Allah. As for those\nwho persist, it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be\nthere forever. 276. Allah has made interest fruitless and charity fruitful. And\nAllah does not like any ungrateful evildoer.\nTrue Believers\n277. Indeed, those who believe, do good, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax\nwill receive their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them,\nnor will they grieve.\nWarning Against Interest\n278. O believers! Fear Allah, and give up outstanding interest if you are\n˹true˺ believers. 279. If you do not, then beware of a war with Allah and His\nMessenger! But if you repent, you may retain your principal—neither\ninflicting nor suffering harm.\nKindness in Collecting Debts\n280. If it is difficult for someone to repay a debt, postpone it until a time of\nease. And if you waive it as an act of charity, it will be better for you, if\nonly you knew.\nReminder of Judgment Day\n\n-- 65 of 694 --\n\n281. Be mindful of the Day when you will ˹all˺ be returned to Allah, then\nevery soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be\nwronged.[118]\nWriting and Witnessing a Debt Contract\n282. O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time,\ncommit it to writing. Let the scribe maintain justice between the parties.\nThe scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write.\nThey will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not\ndefrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate,\nlet their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men\nto witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of\nyour choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may\nremind her.[119] The witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned.\nYou must not be against writing ˹contracts˺ for a fixed period—whether the\nsum is small or great. This is more just ˹for you˺ in the sight of Allah, and\nmore convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you\nconduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need\nfor you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no\nharm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely\nexceeded ˹your limits˺. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah ˹is the One Who˺\nteaches you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.\nTaking Collateral\n283. If you are on a journey and a scribe cannot be found, then a security\ncan be taken. If you trust one another, then ˹there is no need for a security,\nbut˺ the debtor should honour this trust ˹by repaying the debt˺—and let them\nfear Allah, their Lord. And do not conceal the testimony, for whoever\nconceals it, their hearts are indeed sinful. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows what you\ndo.\nAllah’s Might\n284. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on\nthe earth. Whether you reveal what is in your hearts or conceal it, Allah will\ncall you to account for it. He forgives whoever He wills, and punishes\nwhoever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.\nArticles of Faith\n\n-- 66 of 694 --\n\n285. The Messenger ˹firmly˺ believes in what has been revealed to him\nfrom his Lord, and so do the believers. They ˹all˺ believe in Allah, His\nangels, His Books, and His messengers. ˹They proclaim,˺ “We make no\ndistinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and\nobey. ˹We seek˺ Your forgiveness, our Lord! And to You ˹alone˺ is the final\nreturn.”\nPrayer for Grace\n286. Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. All\ngood will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its own loss. ˹The\nbelievers pray,˺ “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a\nmistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us like the one you placed on\nthose before us. Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we cannot bear.\nPardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our ˹only˺ Guardian.\nSo grant us victory over the disbelieving people.”\n***\n\n-- 67 of 694 --\n\n3. The Family of ’Imrân\n(Âli-’Imrân)\nThis Medinian sûrah takes its name from the Family of ’Imrân mentioned in\nverse 33. Like the previous sûrah, it reiterates the fact that Allah is the\nsource of divine revelation and affirms the belief in Allah as the only Lord\nand Islam as His only accepted religion. The story of the birth of Mary,\nJohn the Baptist, and Jesus is mentioned, along with a challenge to the\nChristian perception of Jesus (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). The sûrah also touches on early\nbattles against the Meccan pagans with emphasis on the lessons to be\ndrawn from the Muslims’ defeat at the Battle of U\nḥud, which took place in\n3 A.H./625 C.E. The virtue of being mindful of Allah is highlighted at the\nend of this sûrah and the beginning of the next one.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nScriptures as a Source of Guidance\n1. Alif-Lãm-Mĩm. 2. Allah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him\n—the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. 3. He has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺\nthe Book in truth, confirming what came before it, as He revealed the Torah\nand the Gospel 4. previously, as a guide for people, and ˹also˺ revealed the\nStandard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺.[120] Surely those who\nreject Allah’s revelations will suffer a severe torment. For Allah is\nAlmighty, capable of punishment.\nAllah Almighty\n5. Surely nothing on earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah. 6. He is\nthe One Who shapes you in the wombs of your mothers as He wills. There\nis no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—the Almighty, All-Wise.\nPrecise and Elusive Verses\n7. He is the One Who has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book, of which\nsome verses are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—while\nothers are elusive.[121] Those with deviant hearts follow the elusive verses\nseeking ˹to spread˺ doubt through their ˹false˺ interpretations—but none\ngrasps their ˹full˺ meaning except Allah. As for those well-grounded in\n\n-- 68 of 694 --\n\nknowledge, they say, “We believe in this ˹Quran˺—it is all from our Lord.”\nBut none will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason. 8. ˹They say,˺\n“Our Lord! Do not let our hearts deviate after you have guided us. Grant us\nYour mercy. You are indeed the Giver ˹of all bounties˺. 9. Our Lord! You\nwill certainly gather all humanity for the ˹promised˺ Day—about which\nthere is no doubt. Surely Allah does not break His promise.”\nPunishment of the Disbelievers\n10. Indeed, neither the wealth nor children[122] of the disbelievers will be of\nany benefit to them against Allah—and they will be the fuel for the Fire. 11.\nTheir fate will be like that of the people of Pharaoh and those before them\n—they all rejected Our signs, so Allah seized them for their sins. And Allah\nis severe in punishment. 12. ˹O Prophet!˺ Tell the disbelievers, “Soon you\nwill be overpowered and driven to Hell—what an evil place to rest!”\nAllah’s Help at the Battle of Badr[123]\n13. Indeed, there was a sign for you in the two armies that met in battle—\none fighting for the cause of Allah and the other in denial. The believers\nsaw their enemy twice their number.[124] But Allah supports with His\nvictory whoever He wills. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight.\nTemporary Pleasures\n14. The enjoyment of ˹worldly˺ desires—women, children,[125] treasures of\ngold and silver, fine horses, cattle, and fertile land—has been made\nappealing to people. These are the pleasures of this worldly life, but with\nAllah is the finest destination.\nEverlasting Delight\n15. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall I inform you of what is better than ˹all of˺ this?\nThose mindful ˹of Allah˺ will have Gardens with their Lord under which\nrivers flow, to stay there forever, and pure spouses,[126] along with Allah’s\npleasure.” And Allah is All-Seeing of ˹His˺ servants, 16. who pray, “Our\nLord! We have believed, so forgive our sins and protect us from the torment\nof the Fire.” 17. ˹It is they˺ who are patient, sincere, obedient, and\ncharitable, and who pray for forgiveness before dawn.[127]\nOne God\n18. Allah ˹Himself˺ is a Witness that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺\nexcept Him—and so are the angels and people of knowledge. He is the\n\n-- 69 of 694 --\n\nMaintainer of justice. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—the\nAlmighty, All-Wise.\nOne Way\n19. Certainly, Allah’s only Way is Islam.[128] Those who were given the\nScripture did not dispute ˹among themselves˺ out of mutual envy until\nknowledge came to them.[129] Whoever denies Allah’s signs, then surely\nAllah is swift in reckoning. 20. So if they argue with you ˹O Prophet˺, say,\n“I have submitted myself to Allah, and so have my followers.” And ask\nthose who were given the Scripture and the illiterate ˹people˺,[130] “Have\nyou submitted yourselves ˹to Allah˺?” If they submit, they will be ˹rightly˺\nguided. But if they turn away, then your duty is only to deliver ˹the\nmessage˺. And Allah is All-Seeing of ˹His˺ servants.\nReward of the Rebellious\n21. Indeed, those who deny Allah’s signs, kill the prophets unjustly, and kill\npeople who stand up for justice—give them good news of a painful\npunishment. 22. They are the ones whose deeds are wasted in this world\nand the Hereafter. And they will have no helpers.\nRejecting Allah’s Judgment\n23. Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scriptures?\n[131] Yet when they are invited to the Book of Allah to settle their disputes,\nsome of them turn away heedlessly. 24. This is because they say, “The Fire\nwill not touch us except for a few days.” They have been deceived in their\nfaith by their wishful lying. 25. But how ˹horrible˺ will it be when We\ngather them together on the Day about which there is no doubt—when\nevery soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be\nwronged!\nAllah’s Infinite Power\n26. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O Allah! Lord over all authorities! You give\nauthority to whoever You please and remove it from who You please; You\nhonour whoever You please and disgrace who You please—all good is in\nYour Hands. Surely You ˹alone˺ are Most Capable of everything. 27. You\ncause the night to pass into the day and the day into the night. You bring\nforth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. And You\nprovide for whoever You will without limit.”\n\n-- 70 of 694 --\n\nTaking Disbelievers as Guardians[132]\n28. Believers should not take disbelievers as guardians instead of the\nbelievers—and whoever does so will have nothing to hope for from Allah—\nunless it is a precaution against their tyranny. And Allah warns you about\nHimself. And to Allah is the final return.\nAllah’s Infinite Knowledge\n29. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Whether you conceal what is in your hearts or reveal\nit, it is known to Allah. For He knows whatever is in the heavens and\nwhatever is on the earth. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.”\nAccountability for Good and Evil\n30. ˹Watch for˺ the Day when every soul will be presented with whatever\ngood it has done. And it will wish that its misdeeds were far off. And Allah\nwarns you about Himself. And Allah is Ever Gracious to ˹His˺ servants.\nObeying Allah and His Messenger\n31. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If you ˹sincerely˺ love Allah, then follow me; Allah\nwill love you and forgive your sins. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful.” 32. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Obey Allah and His Messenger.” If they\nstill turn away, then truly Allah does not like the disbelievers.\nBlessed People\n33. Indeed, Allah chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the\nfamily of ’Imrân above all people ˹of their time˺. 34. They are descendants\nof one another. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\nBirth of Mary\n35. ˹Remember˺ when the wife of ’Imrân said, “My Lord! I dedicate what is\nin my womb entirely to Your service,[133] so accept it from me. You ˹alone˺\nare truly the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.” 36. When she delivered, she said,\n“My Lord! I have given birth to a girl,”—and Allah fully knew what she\nhad delivered—“and the male is not like the female.[134] I have named her\nMary, and I seek Your protection for her and her offspring from Satan, the\naccursed.”[135] 37. So her Lord accepted her graciously and blessed her with\na pleasant upbringing—entrusting her to the care of Zachariah. Whenever\nZachariah visited her in the sanctuary, he found her supplied with\nprovisions. He exclaimed, “O Mary! Where did this come from?” She\n\n-- 71 of 694 --\n\nreplied, “It is from Allah. Surely Allah provides for whoever He wills\nwithout limit.”\nBirth of John the Baptist\n38. Then and there Zachariah prayed to his Lord, saying, “My Lord! Grant\nme—by your grace—righteous offspring. You are certainly the Hearer of\n˹all˺ prayers.” 39. So the angels called out to him while he stood praying in\nthe sanctuary, “Allah gives you good news of ˹the birth of˺ John who will\nconfirm the Word of Allah and will be a great leader, chaste, and a prophet\namong the righteous.” 40. Zachariah exclaimed, “My Lord! How can I have\na son when I am very old and my wife is barren?” He replied, “So will it be.\nAllah does what He wills.” 41. Zachariah said, “My Lord! Grant me a\nsign.” He said, “Your sign is that you will not ˹be able to˺ speak to people\nfor three days except through gestures. Remember your Lord often and\nglorify ˹Him˺ morning and evening.”\nMary Chosen over All Women\n42. And ˹remember˺ when the angels said, “O Mary! Surely Allah has\nselected you, purified you, and chosen you over all women of the world. 43.\nO Mary! Be devout to your Lord, prostrate yourself ˹in prayer˺ and bow\nalong with those who bow down.” 44. This is news of the unseen that We\nreveal to you ˹O Prophet˺. You were not with them when they cast lots to\ndecide who would be Mary’s guardian, nor were you there when they\nargued ˹about it˺.\nBirth of Jesus Christ\n45. ˹Remember˺ when the angels proclaimed, “O Mary! Allah gives you\ngood news of a Word[136] from Him, his name will be the Messiah,[137]\nJesus, son of Mary; honoured in this world and the Hereafter, and he will be\none of those nearest ˹to Allah˺. 46. And he will speak to people in ˹his˺\ninfancy and adulthood and will be one of the righteous.” 47. Mary\nwondered, “My Lord! How can I have a child when no man has ever\ntouched me?” An angel replied, “So will it be. Allah creates what He wills.\nWhen He decrees a matter, He simply tells it, ‘Be!’ And it is!\nThe Mission and Miracles of Jesus\n48. “And Allah will teach him writing and wisdom, the Torah and the\nGospel, 49. and ˹make him˺ a messenger to the Children of Israel ˹to\n\n-- 72 of 694 --\n\nproclaim,˺ ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will make for\nyou a bird from clay, breathe into it, and it will become a ˹real˺ bird—by\nAllah’s Will. I will heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead to life—\nby Allah’s Will. And I will prophesize what you eat and store in your\nhouses. Surely in this is a sign for you if you ˹truly˺ believe. 50. And I will\nconfirm the Torah revealed before me and legalize some of what had been\nforbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so be\nmindful of Allah and obey me. 51. Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord.\nSo worship Him ˹alone˺. This is the Straight Path.’”\nThe Disciples\n52. When Jesus sensed disbelief from his people, he asked, “Who will stand\nup with me for Allah?” The disciples replied, “We will stand up for Allah.\nWe believe in Allah, so bear witness that we have submitted.” 53. ˹They\nprayed to Allah,˺ “Our Lord! We believe in Your revelations and follow the\nmessenger, so count us among those who bear witness.”\nConspiracy Against Jesus\n54. And the disbelievers made a plan ˹against Jesus˺, but Allah also planned\n—and Allah is the best of planners. 55. ˹Remember˺ when Allah said, “O\nJesus! I will take you[138] and raise you up to Myself. I will deliver you\nfrom those who disbelieve, and elevate your followers above the\ndisbelievers until the Day of Judgment. Then to Me you will ˹all˺ return,\nand I will settle all your disputes.\nFair Reward\n56. “As for those who disbelieve, I will subject them to a severe punishment\nin this life and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. 57. And as for\nthose who believe and do good, they will be rewarded in full. And Allah\ndoes not like the wrongdoers.” 58. We recite ˹all˺ this to you ˹O Prophet˺ as\none of the signs[139] and ˹as˺ a wise reminder.\nJesus and Adam\n59. Indeed, the example of Jesus in the sight of Allah is like that of Adam.\nHe created him from dust, then said to him, “Be!” And he was! 60. This is\nthe truth from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt.\nDisputes over Jesus\n\n-- 73 of 694 --\n\n61. Now, whoever disputes with you ˹O Prophet˺ concerning Jesus after full\nknowledge has come to you, say, “Come! Let us gather our children and\nyour children, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves—\nthen let us sincerely invoke Allah’s curse upon the liars.” 62. Certainly, this\nis the true narrative, and there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Allah.\nAnd indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ is the Almighty, All-Wise. 63. If they turn away,\nthen surely Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the corruptors.\nDevotion to Allah Alone\n64. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! Let us come to common\nterms: that we will worship none but Allah, associate none with Him, nor\ntake one another as lords instead of Allah.” But if they turn away, then say,\n“Bear witness that we have submitted ˹to Allah alone˺.”\nThe Truth About Abraham\n65. O People of the Book! Why do you argue about Abraham, while the\nTorah and the Gospel were not revealed until long after him? Do you not\nunderstand? 66. Here you are! You disputed about what you have ˹little˺\nknowledge of,[140] but why do you now argue about what you have no\nknowledge of?[141] Allah knows and you do not know. 67. Abraham was\nneither a Jew nor a Christian; he submitted in all uprightness[142] and was\nnot a polytheist. 68. Indeed, those who have the best claim to Abraham are\nhis followers, this Prophet,[143] and the believers. And Allah is the Guardian\nof those who believe.\nDistorting the Truth\n69. Some of the People of the Book wish to mislead you ˹believers˺. They\nmislead none but themselves, yet they fail to perceive it. 70. O People of the\nBook! Why do you reject the signs of Allah while you bear witness ˹to their\ntruth˺? 71. O People of the Book! Why do you mix the truth with falsehood\nand hide the truth knowingly?\nDeception Exposed\n72. A group among the People of the Book said ˹to one another˺, “Believe\nin what has been revealed to the believers in the morning and reject it in the\nevening, so they may abandon their faith. 73. And only believe those who\nfollow your religion.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely, ˹the only˺ true guidance is\nAllah’s guidance.” ˹They also said,˺ “Do not believe that someone will\n\n-- 74 of 694 --\n\nreceive ˹revealed˺ knowledge similar to yours or argue against you before\nyour Lord.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, all bounty is in the Hands of Allah—\nHe grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-\nKnowing.” 74. He chooses whoever He wills to receive His mercy. And\nAllah is the Lord of infinite bounty.\nHonouring Trusts\n75. There are some among the People of the Book who, if entrusted with a\nstack of gold, will readily return it. Yet there are others who, if entrusted\nwith a single coin, will not repay it unless you constantly demand it. This is\nbecause they say, “We are not accountable for ˹exploiting˺ the\nGentiles.”[144] And ˹so˺ they attribute lies to Allah knowingly. 76.\nAbsolutely! Those who honour their trusts and shun evil—surely Allah\nloves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺.\nBreaking Allah’s Covenant\n77. Indeed, those who trade Allah’s covenant and their oaths for a fleeting\ngain will have no share in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them,\nnor look at them, nor purify them on the Day of Judgment. And they will\nsuffer a painful punishment.\nDistorting the Scripture\n78. There are some among them who distort the Book with their tongues to\nmake you think this ˹distortion˺ is from the Book—but it is not what the\nBook says. They say, “It is from Allah”—but it is not from Allah. And ˹so˺\nthey attribute lies to Allah knowingly.\nProphets Never Claim Divinity\n79. It is not appropriate for someone who Allah has blessed with the\nScripture, wisdom, and prophethood to say to people, “Worship me instead\nof Allah.” Rather, he would say, “Be devoted to the worship of your Lord\n˹alone˺”—in accordance with what these prophets read in the Scripture and\nwhat they taught. 80. And he would never ask you to take angels and\nprophets as lords. Would he ask you to disbelieve after you have submitted?\nAllah’s Covenant with Prophets\n81. ˹Remember˺ when Allah made a covenant with the prophets, ˹saying,˺\n“Now that I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a\nmessenger[145] confirming what you have, you must believe in him and\n\n-- 75 of 694 --\n\nsupport him.” He added, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this\ncommitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” Allah said, “Then bear witness,\nand I too am a Witness.” 82. Whoever turns back after this, they will be the\nrebellious.\nFull Submission\n83. Do they desire a way other than Allah’s—knowing that all those in the\nheavens and the earth submit to His Will, willingly or unwillingly, and to\nHim they will ˹all˺ be returned?\nProphets of Islam\n84. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us\nand what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his\ndescendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from\ntheir Lord—we make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we\n˹fully˺ submit.”\nThe Only Way\n85. Whoever seeks a way other than Islam,[146] it will never be accepted\nfrom them, and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers.\nDeviating from the Right Path\n86. How will Allah guide a people who chose to disbelieve after they had\nbelieved, acknowledged the Messenger to be true, and received clear\nproofs? For Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. 87. Their reward\nis that they will be condemned by Allah, the angels, and all of humanity. 88.\nThey will be in Hell forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor\nwill they be delayed ˹from it˺. 89. As for those who repent afterwards and\nmend their ways, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nDying in a State of Disbelief\n90. Indeed, those who disbelieve after having believed then increase in\ndisbelief, their repentance will never be accepted.[147] It is they who are\nastray. 91. Indeed, if each of those who disbelieve then die as disbelievers\nwere to offer a ransom of enough gold to fill the whole world, it would\nnever be accepted from them. It is they who will suffer a painful\npunishment, and they will have no helpers.\nRighteous Giving\n\n-- 76 of 694 --\n\n92. You will never achieve righteousness until you donate some of what you\ncherish. And whatever you give is certainly well known to Allah.\nJacob’s Dietary Restriction\n93. All food was lawful for the children of Israel, except what Israel[148]\nmade unlawful for himself before the Torah was revealed.[149] Say, ˹O\nProphet,˺ “Bring the Torah and read it, if your claims are true.” 94. Then\nwhoever still fabricates lies about Allah, they will be the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.\n95. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah has declared the truth. So follow the Way of\nAbraham, the upright—who was not a polytheist.”\nPilgrimage to the Sacred House in Mecca\n96. Surely the first House ˹of worship˺ established for humanity is the one\nat Bakkah—a blessed sanctuary and a guide for ˹all˺ people. 97. In it are\nclear signs and the standing-place of Abraham. Whoever enters it should be\nsafe. Pilgrimage to this House is an obligation by Allah upon whoever is\nable among the people.[150] And whoever disbelieves, then surely Allah is\nnot in need of ˹any of His˺ creation.\nRejecting the Truth\n98. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! Why do you deny the\nrevelations of Allah, when Allah is a Witness to what you do?” 99. Say, “O\nPeople of the Book! Why do you turn the believers away from the Way of\nAllah—striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, while you are witnesses ˹to its\ntruth˺? And Allah is never unaware of what you do.”\nWarning Against Evil Influence\n100. O believers! If you were to yield to a group of those who were given\nthe Scripture, they would turn you back from belief to disbelief. 101. How\ncan you disbelieve when Allah’s revelations are recited to you and His\nMessenger is in your midst? Whoever holds firmly to Allah is surely guided\nto the Straight Path.\nWarning Against Disunity\n102. O believers! Be mindful of Allah in the way He deserves,[151] and do\nnot die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission ˹to Him˺.[152] 103. And hold\nfirmly to the rope of Allah[153] and do not be divided. Remember Allah’s\nfavour upon you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts, so\nyou—by His grace—became brothers. And you were at the brink of a fiery\n\n-- 77 of 694 --\n\npit and He saved you from it. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear\nto you, so that you may be ˹rightly˺ guided. 104. Let there be a group\namong you who call ˹others˺ to goodness, encourage what is good, and\nforbid what is evil—it is they who will be successful. 105. And do not be\nlike those who split ˹into sects˺ and differed after clear proofs had come to\nthem. It is they who will suffer a tremendous punishment.\nThe Joyful and the Miserable\n106. On that Day some faces will be bright while others gloomy. To the\ngloomy-faced it will be said, “Did you disbelieve after having believed? So\ntaste the punishment for your disbelief.” 107. As for the bright-faced, they\nwill be in Allah’s mercy, where they will remain forever. 108. These are\nAllah’s revelations We recite to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth. And Allah desires\nno injustice to ˹His˺ creation. 109. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in\nthe heavens and whatever is on the earth. And to Allah ˹all˺ matters will be\nreturned ˹for judgment˺.\nExcellence of the Muslim Nation\n110. You are the best community ever raised for humanity—you encourage\ngood, forbid evil, and believe in Allah. Had the People of the Book\nbelieved, it would have been better for them. Some of them are faithful, but\nmost are rebellious.\nReward of the Rebellious\n111. They can never inflict harm on you, except a little annoyance.[154] But\nif they meet you in battle, they will flee and they will have no helpers. 112.\nThey will be stricken with disgrace wherever they go, unless they are\nprotected by a covenant with Allah or a treaty with the people. They have\ninvited the displeasure of Allah and have been branded with misery for\nrejecting Allah’s revelations and murdering ˹His˺ prophets unjustly. This is\n˹a fair reward˺ for their disobedience and violations.\nUpright People of the Book\n113. Yet they are not all alike: there are some among the People of the Book\nwho are upright, who recite Allah’s revelations throughout the night,\nprostrating ˹in prayer˺. 114. They believe in Allah and the Last Day,\nencourage good and forbid evil, and race with one another in doing good.\nThey are ˹truly˺ among the righteous. 115. They will never be denied the\n\n-- 78 of 694 --\n\nreward for any good they have done. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of\nthose mindful ˹of Him˺.\nWarning Against Hypocrites\n116. Indeed, neither the wealth nor children of the disbelievers will be of\nany benefit to them against Allah. It is they who will be the residents of the\nFire. They will be there forever. 117. The good they do in this worldly life\nis like the harvest of an evil people struck by a bitter wind, destroying it\n˹completely˺. Allah never wronged them, but they wronged themselves.\nAssociation with Hypocrites\n118. O believers! Do not associate closely with others who would not miss\na chance to harm you. Their only desire is to see you suffer. Their prejudice\nhas become evident from what they say—and what their hearts hide is far\nworse. We have made Our revelations clear to you, if only you understood.\n119. Here you are! You love them but they do not love you, and you believe\nin all Scriptures. When they meet you they say, “We believe.” But when\nalone, they bite their fingertips in rage. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹May you˺ die of\nyour rage!” Surely Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. 120.\nWhen you ˹believers˺ are touched with good, they grieve; but when you are\nafflicted with evil, they rejoice. ˹Yet,˺ if you are patient and mindful ˹of\nAllah˺, their schemes will not harm you in the least. Surely Allah is Fully\nAware of what they do.\nThe Battle of U\nḥud[155]\n121. ˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when you left your home in the early morning\nto position the believers in the battlefield. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-\nKnowing. 122. ˹Remember˺ when two groups among you ˹believers˺ were\nabout to cower, then Allah reassured them. So in Allah let the believers put\ntheir trust.\nThe Battle of Badr\n123. Indeed, Allah made you victorious at Badr when you were ˹vastly˺\noutnumbered. So be mindful of Allah, perhaps you will be grateful. 124.\n˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when you said to the believers, “Is it not enough\nthat your Lord will send down a reinforcement of three thousand angels for\nyour aid?” 125. Most certainly, if you ˹believers˺ are firm and mindful ˹of\nAllah˺ and the enemy launches a sudden attack on you, Allah will reinforce\n\n-- 79 of 694 --\n\nyou with five thousand angels designated ˹for battle˺. 126. Allah ordained\nthis ˹reinforcement˺ only as good news for you and reassurance for your\nhearts. And victory comes only from Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise—\n127. to destroy a group of the disbelievers and humble the rest, causing\nthem to withdraw in disappointment.\nAllah Is the Judge\n128. You ˹O Prophet˺ have no say in the matter.[156] It is up to Allah to turn\nto them in mercy or punish them, for indeed they are wrongdoers. 129. To\nAllah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the\nearth. He forgives whoever He wills, and punishes whoever He wills. And\nAllah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nWarning Against Interest\n130. O believers! Do not consume interest, multiplying it many times over.\nAnd be mindful of Allah, so you may prosper. 131. Guard yourselves\nagainst the Fire prepared for the disbelievers. 132. Obey Allah and the\nMessenger, so you may be shown mercy.\nReward of the Righteous\n133. And hasten towards forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as vast\nas the heavens and the earth, prepared for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. 134.\n˹They are˺ those who donate in prosperity and adversity, control their anger,\nand pardon others. And Allah loves the good-doers. 135. ˹They are˺ those\nwho, upon committing an evil deed or wronging themselves, remember\nAllah and seek forgiveness and do not knowingly persist in sin—and who\nforgives sins except Allah? 136. Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord\nand Gardens under which rivers flow, staying there forever. How excellent\nis the reward for those who work ˹righteousness˺!\nBattle Between Good and Evil\n137. Similar situations came to pass before you, so travel throughout the\nland and see the fate of the deniers. 138. This[157] is an insight to humanity\n—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.\nReassuring the Believers\n139. Do not falter or grieve, for you will have the upper hand, if you are\n˹true˺ believers. 140. If you have suffered injuries ˹at Uḥud˺, they suffered\nsimilarly ˹at Badr˺. We alternate these days ˹of victory and defeat˺ among\n\n-- 80 of 694 --\n\npeople so that Allah may reveal the ˹true˺ believers, choose martyrs from\namong you—and Allah does not like the wrongdoers— 141. and distinguish\nthe ˹true˺ believers and destroy the disbelievers.\nBelievers Tested\n142. Do you think you will enter Paradise without Allah proving which of\nyou ˹truly˺ struggled ˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured? 143. You\ncertainly wished ˹for the opportunity˺ for martyrdom before encountering it,\nnow you have seen it with your own eyes.\nBelievers Disheartened[158]\n144. Muḥammad is no more than a messenger; other messengers have gone\nbefore him. If he were to die or to be killed, would you regress into\ndisbelief? Those who do so will not harm Allah whatsoever. And Allah will\nreward those who are grateful. 145. No soul can ever die without Allah’s\nWill at the destined time. Those who desire worldly gain, We will let them\nhave it, and those who desire heavenly reward, We will grant it to them.\nAnd We will reward those who are grateful.\nReward of the Steadfast\n146. ˹Imagine˺ how many devotees fought along with their prophets and\nnever faltered despite whatever ˹losses˺ they suffered in the cause of Allah,\nnor did they weaken or give in! Allah loves those who persevere. 147. And\nall they said was, “Our Lord! Forgive our sins and excesses, make our steps\nfirm, and grant us victory over the disbelieving people.” 148. So Allah gave\nthem the reward of this world and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For\nAllah loves the good-doers.\nYielding to the Disbelievers\n149. O believers! If you yield to the disbelievers, they will drag you back to\ndisbelief—and you will become losers. 150. But no! Allah is your\nGuardian, and He is the best Helper. 151. We will cast horror into the hearts\nof the disbelievers for associating ˹false gods˺ with Allah—a practice He\nhas never authorized. The Fire will be their home—what an evil place for\nthe wrongdoers to stay!\nVictory Denied at U\nḥud\n152. Indeed, Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you ˹initially˺ swept\nthem away by His Will, then your courage weakened and you disputed\n\n-- 81 of 694 --\n\nabout the command and disobeyed,[159] after Allah had brought victory\nwithin your reach. Some of you were after worldly gain while others\ndesired a heavenly reward. He denied you victory over them as a test, yet\nHe has pardoned you. And Allah is Gracious to the believers.\nThe Army Retreats\n153. ˹Remember˺ when you were running far away ˹in panic˺—not looking\nat anyone—while the Messenger was calling to you from behind! So Allah\nrewarded your disobedience with distress upon distress. Now, do not grieve\nover the victory you were denied or the injury you suffered. And Allah is\nAll-Aware of what you do. 154. Then after distress, He sent down serenity\nin the form of drowsiness overcoming some of you, while others were\ndisturbed by evil thoughts about Allah—the thoughts of ˹pre-Islamic˺\nignorance. They ask, “Do we have a say in the matter?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“All matters are destined by Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they\ndo not reveal to you. They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the\nmatter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if\nyou were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to\nbe killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, Allah tests what is\nwithin you and purifies what is in your hearts. And Allah knows best what\nis ˹hidden˺ in the heart.\nThe Deserters\n155. Indeed, those ˹believers˺ who fled on the day when the two armies met\nwere made to slip by Satan because of their misdeeds. But Allah has\npardoned them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.\nIt Is All Destined\n156. O believers! Do not be like the unfaithful[160] who say about their\nbrothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, “If they had\nstayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” Allah makes such\nthinking a cause of agony in their hearts. It is Allah who gives life and\ncauses death. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. 157. Should you be\nmartyred or die in the cause of Allah, then His forgiveness and mercy are\nfar better than whatever ˹wealth˺ those ˹who stay behind˺ accumulate. 158.\nWhether you die or are martyred—all of you will be gathered before Allah.\nProphet’s Kindness to the Believers\n\n-- 82 of 694 --\n\n159. It is out of Allah’s mercy that you ˹O Prophet˺ have been lenient with\nthem. Had you been cruel or hard-hearted, they would have certainly\nabandoned you. So pardon them, ask Allah’s forgiveness for them, and\nconsult with them in ˹conducting˺ matters. Once you make a decision, put\nyour trust in Allah. Surely Allah loves those who trust in Him.\nVictory Is from Allah\n160. If Allah helps you, none can defeat you. But if He denies you help,\nthen who else can help you? So in Allah let the believers put their trust.\nSpoils of War\n161. It is not appropriate for a prophet to illegally withhold spoils of war.\nAnd whoever does so, it will be held against them on the Day of Judgment.\nThen every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be\nwronged.\nGood-Doers and Wrongdoers\n162. Are those who seek Allah’s pleasure like those who deserve Allah’s\nwrath? Hell is their home. What an evil destination! 163. They ˹each˺ have\nvarying degrees in the sight of Allah. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they\ndo.\nThe Prophet as a Blessing\n164. Indeed, Allah has done the believers a ˹great˺ favour by raising a\nmessenger from among them—reciting to them His revelations, purifying\nthem, and teaching them the Book and wisdom. For indeed they had\npreviously been clearly astray.\nLessons from the Battle of U\nḥud\n165. Why is it when you suffered casualties ˹at Uḥud˺—although you had\nmade your enemy suffer twice as much ˹at Badr˺—you protested, “How\ncould this be?”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It is because of your disobedience.”\nSurely Allah is Most Capable of everything. 166. So what you suffered on\nthe day the two armies met was by Allah’s Will, so that He might\ndistinguish the ˹true˺ believers 167. and expose the hypocrites. When it was\nsaid to them, “Come fight in the cause of Allah or ˹at least˺ defend\nyourselves,” they replied, “If we had known there was fighting, we would\nhave definitely gone with you.” They were closer to disbelief than to belief\non that day—for saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts.\n\n-- 83 of 694 --\n\nAllah is All-Knowing of what they hide. 168. Those who sat at home,\nsaying about their brothers, “Had they listened to us, they would not have\nbeen killed.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Try not to die[161] if what you say is true!”\nMartyrs Honoured\n169. Never think of those martyred in the cause of Allah as dead. In fact,\nthey are alive with their Lord, well provided for— 170. rejoicing in Allah’s\nbounties and being delighted for those yet to join them. There will be no\nfear for them, nor will they grieve. 171. They are joyful for receiving\nAllah’s grace and bounty, and that Allah does not deny the reward of the\nbelievers.\nReward of the Steadfast\n172. ˹As for˺ those who responded to the call of Allah and His Messenger\nafter their injury,[162] those of them who did good and were mindful ˹of\nAllah˺ will have a great reward. 173. Those who were warned, “Your\nenemies have mobilized their forces against you, so fear them,” the warning\nonly made them grow stronger in faith and they replied, “Allah ˹alone˺ is\nsufficient ˹as an aid˺ for us and ˹He˺ is the best Protector.” 174. So they\nreturned with Allah’s favours and grace, suffering no harm. For they sought\nto please Allah. And surely Allah is ˹the˺ Lord of infinite bounty. 175. That\n˹warning˺ was only ˹from˺ Satan, trying to prompt you to fear his followers.\n[163] So do not fear them; fear Me if you are ˹true˺ believers.\nDisbelievers’ Delusion\n176. ˹O Prophet!˺ Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—surely\nthey will not harm Allah in the least. It is Allah’s Will to disallow them a\nshare in the Hereafter, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment. 177.\nThose who trade belief for disbelief will never harm Allah in the least, and\nthey will suffer a painful punishment. 178. Those who disbelieve should not\nthink that living longer is good for them. They are only given more time to\nincrease in sin, and they will suffer a humiliating punishment.\nSincerity Test\n179. Allah would not leave the believers in the condition you were in, until\nHe distinguished the good from the evil ˹among you˺. Nor would Allah\n˹directly˺ reveal to you the unseen,[164] but He chooses whoever He wills as\n\n-- 84 of 694 --\n\na messenger. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And if you are\nfaithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, you will receive a great reward.\nReward of the Stingy\n180. And do not let those who ˹greedily˺ withhold Allah’s bounties think it\nis good for them—in fact, it is bad for them! They will be leashed ˹by their\nnecks˺ on the Day of Judgment with whatever ˹wealth˺ they used to\nwithhold. And Allah is the ˹sole˺ inheritor of the heavens and the earth. And\nAllah is All-Aware of what you do.\nBlasphemy Exposed\n181. Indeed, Allah has heard those ˹among the Jews˺ who said, “Allah is\npoor; we are rich!” We have certainly recorded their slurs and their killing\nof prophets unjustly. Then We will say, “Taste the torment of burning! 182.\nThis is ˹the reward˺ for what your hands have done. And Allah is never\nunjust to ˹His˺ creation.”\nRejecting Allah’s Messengers\n183. Those ˹are the same people˺ who say, “Allah has commanded us not to\nbelieve in any messenger unless he brings us an offering to be consumed by\nfire ˹from the sky˺.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Other prophets did in fact come to\nyou[165] before me with clear proofs and ˹even˺ what you demanded—why\nthen did you kill them, if what you say is true?” 184. If you are rejected by\nthem, so too were messengers before you who came with clear proofs,\ndivine Books, and enlightening Scriptures.[166]\nDeath Is Inevitable\n185. Every soul will taste death. And you will only receive your full reward\non the Day of Judgment. Whoever is spared from the Fire and is admitted\ninto Paradise will ˹indeed˺ triumph, whereas the life of this world is no\nmore than the delusion of enjoyment.\nPatience Tested\n186. You ˹believers˺ will surely be tested in your wealth and yourselves,[167]\nand you will certainly hear many hurtful words from those who were given\nthe Scripture before you and ˹from˺ the polytheists. But if you are patient\nand mindful ˹of Allah˺—surely this is a resolve to aspire to.\nBreaking Allah’s Covenant\n\n-- 85 of 694 --\n\n187. ˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when Allah took the covenant of those who\nwere given the Scripture to make it known to people and not hide it, yet\nthey cast it behind their backs and traded it for a fleeting gain. What a\nmiserable profit! 188. Do not let those who rejoice in their misdeeds and\nlove to take credit for what they have not done think they will escape\ntorment. They will suffer a painful punishment.\nAllah’s Signs\n189. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.\nAnd Allah is Most Capable of everything. 190. Indeed, in the creation of\nthe heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and night there are\nsigns for people of reason.\nA Prayer of the Righteous\n191. ˹They are˺ those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and\nlying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth\n˹and pray˺, “Our Lord! You have not created ˹all of˺ this without purpose.\nGlory be to You! Protect us from the torment of the Fire. 192. Our Lord!\nIndeed, those You commit to the Fire will be ˹completely˺ disgraced! And\nthe wrongdoers will have no helpers. 193. Our Lord! We have heard the\ncaller[168] to ˹true˺ belief, ˹proclaiming,˺ ‘Believe in your Lord ˹alone˺,’ so\nwe believed. Our Lord! Forgive our sins, absolve us of our misdeeds, and\nallow us ˹each˺ to die as one of the virtuous. 194. Our Lord! Grant us what\nYou have promised us through Your messengers and do not put us to shame\non Judgment Day—for certainly You never fail in Your promise.”\nPrayers Answered\n195. So their Lord responded to them: “I will never deny any of you—male\nor female—the reward of your deeds. Both are equal in reward. Those who\nmigrated or were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted for My\nsake and fought and ˹some˺ were martyred—I will certainly forgive their\nsins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, as a reward from\nAllah. And with Allah is the finest reward!”\nDisbelievers’ Brief Enjoyment\n196. Do not be deceived by the prosperity of the disbelievers throughout the\nland. 197. It is only a brief enjoyment. Then Hell will be their home—what\nan evil place to rest!\n\n-- 86 of 694 --\n\nBelievers’ Everlasting Delight\n198. But those who are mindful of their Lord will be in Gardens under\nwhich rivers flow, to stay there forever—as an accommodation from Allah.\nAnd what is with Allah is best for the virtuous.\nBelievers Among People of the Book\n199. Indeed, there are some among the People of the Book who truly\nbelieve in Allah and what has been revealed to you ˹believers˺ and what was\nrevealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah—never trading\nAllah’s revelations for a fleeting gain. Their reward is with their Lord.\nSurely Allah is swift in reckoning.\nAdvice for Success\n200. O believers! Patiently endure, persevere, stand on guard,[169] and be\nmindful of Allah, so you may be successful.\n***\n\n-- 87 of 694 --\n\n4. Women\n(An-Nisâ')\nThis sûrah focuses on the rights of women (hence the sûrah’s name), the law\nof inheritance, care for orphans, lawful and unlawful women to marry, and\nstanding for justice (see the remarkable example of justice to a Jew in\nverses 105-112). As the sûrah progresses, the focus shifts to the etiquette of\nstriving in the cause of Allah and the relationship between Muslims and the\nPeople of the Book, culminating in a rebuttal to the claims about the\ncrucifixion and divinity of Jesus (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Like the previous and the next\nsûrahs, this sûrah also deals with the issue of hypocrisy—a common theme\nin many other Medinian sûrahs.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nCommitment to Allah and Kinship Ties\n1. O humanity! Be mindful of your Lord Who created you from a single\nsoul, and from it He created its mate,[170] and through both He spread\ncountless men and women. And be mindful of Allah—in Whose Name you\nappeal to one another—and ˹honour˺ family ties. Surely Allah is ever\nWatchful over you.\nOrphans Given back Their Wealth\n2. Give orphans their wealth ˹when they reach maturity˺, and do not\nexchange your worthless possessions for their valuables, nor cheat them by\nmixing their wealth with your own. For this would indeed be a great sin.\nBridal Gifts\n3. If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their ˹due˺ rights ˹if you\nwere to marry them˺, then marry other women of your choice—two, three,\nor four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then ˹content\nyourselves with˺ one[171] or those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession.[172]\nThis way you are less likely to commit injustice. 4. Give women ˹you wed˺\ntheir due dowries graciously. But if they waive some of it willingly, then\nyou may enjoy it freely with a clear conscience.\nManaging Wealth Responsibly\n\n-- 88 of 694 --\n\n5. Do not entrust the incapable ˹among your dependants˺ with your wealth\nwhich Allah has made a means of support for you—but feed and clothe\nthem from it, and speak to them kindly.\nOrphans’ Wealth\n6. Test ˹the competence of˺ the orphans until they reach a marriageable age.\nThen if you feel they are capable of sound judgment, return their wealth to\nthem. And do not consume it wastefully and hastily before they grow up ˹to\ndemand it˺. If the guardian is well-off, they should not take compensation;\nbut if the guardian is poor, let them take a reasonable provision. When you\ngive orphans back their property, call in witnesses. And sufficient is Allah\nas a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner.\nInheritance Law[173] 1) Males and Females\n7. For men there is a share in what their parents and close relatives leave,\nand for women there is a share in what their parents and close relatives\nleave—whether it is little or much. ˹These are˺ obligatory shares.\nActs of Kindness\n8. If ˹non-inheriting˺ relatives, orphans,[174] or the needy are present at the\ntime of distribution, offer them a ˹small˺ provision from it and speak to\nthem kindly.\nCaring for Orphans\n9. Let the guardians be as concerned ˹for the orphans˺ as they would if they\nwere to ˹die and˺ leave ˹their own˺ helpless children behind. So let them be\nmindful of Allah and speak equitably. 10. Indeed, those who unjustly\nconsume orphans’ wealth ˹in fact˺ consume nothing but fire into their\nbellies. And they will be burned in a blazing Hell!\nInheritance Law 2) Offspring and Parents\n11. Allah commands you regarding your children: the share of the male will\nbe twice that of the female.[175] If you leave only two ˹or more˺ females,\ntheir share is two-thirds of the estate. But if there is only one female, her\nshare will be one-half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if you leave\noffspring.[176] But if you are childless and your parents are the only heirs,\nthen your mother will receive one-third.[177] But if you leave siblings, then\nyour mother will receive one-sixth[178]—after the fulfilment of bequests and\ndebts.[179] ˹Be fair to˺ your parents and children, as you do not ˹fully˺ know\n\n-- 89 of 694 --\n\nwho is more beneficial to you.[180] ˹This is˺ an obligation from Allah.\nSurely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nInheritance Law 3) Spouses, 4) Maternal Siblings\n12. You will inherit half of what your wives leave if they are childless. But\nif they have children, then ˹your share is˺ one-fourth of the estate—after the\nfulfilment of bequests and debts. And your wives will inherit one-fourth of\nwhat you leave if you are childless. But if you have children, then your\nwives will receive one-eighth of your estate—after the fulfilment of\nbequests and debts. And if a man or a woman leaves neither parents nor\nchildren but only a brother or a sister ˹from their mother’s side˺, they will\neach inherit one-sixth, but if they are more than one, they ˹all˺ will share\none-third of the estate[181]—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts\nwithout harm ˹to the heirs˺.[182] ˹This is˺ a commandment from Allah. And\nAllah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.\nCompliance with Inheritance Laws\n13. These ˹entitlements˺ are the limits set by Allah. Whoever obeys Allah\nand His Messenger will be admitted into Gardens under which rivers flow,\nto stay there forever. That is the ultimate triumph! 14. But whoever\ndisobeys Allah and His Messenger and exceeds their limits will be cast into\nHell, to stay there forever. And they will suffer a humiliating punishment.\nIllegal Sexual Relationships[183]\n15. ˹As for˺ those of your women who commit illegal intercourse—call four\nwitnesses from among yourselves. If they testify, confine the offenders to\ntheir homes until they die or Allah ordains a ˹different˺ way for them. 16.\nAnd the two among you who commit this sin—discipline them. If they\nrepent and mend their ways, relieve them. Surely Allah is ever Accepting of\nRepentance, Most Merciful.\nAccepted and Rejected Repentance\n17. Allah only accepts the repentance of those who commit evil ignorantly\n˹or recklessly˺ then repent soon after[184]—Allah will pardon them. And\nAllah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. 18. However, repentance is not accepted\nfrom those who knowingly persist in sin until they start dying, and then cry,\n“Now I repent!” nor those who die as disbelievers. For them We have\nprepared a painful punishment.\n\n-- 90 of 694 --\n\nAbusing Women Financially\n19. O believers! It is not permissible for you to inherit women against their\nwill[185] or mistreat them to make them return some of the dowry ˹as a\nransom for divorce˺—unless they are found guilty of adultery.[186] Treat\nthem fairly. If you happen to dislike them, you may hate something which\nAllah turns into a great blessing. 20. If you desire to replace a wife with\nanother and you have given the former ˹even˺ a stack of gold ˹as a dowry˺,\ndo not take any of it back. Would you ˹still˺ take it unjustly and very\nsinfully? 21. And how could you take it back after having enjoyed each\nother intimately and she has taken from you a firm commitment?[187]\nLawful and Unlawful Women to Marry[188]\n22. Do not marry former wives of your fathers—except what was done\npreviously. It was indeed a shameful, despicable, and evil practice. 23.\n˹Also˺ forbidden to you for marriage are your mothers, your daughters, your\nsisters, your paternal and maternal aunts, your brother’s daughters, your\nsister’s daughters, your foster-mothers, your foster-sisters, your mothers-in-\nlaw, your stepdaughters under your guardianship if you have consummated\nmarriage with their mothers—but if you have not, then you can marry them\n—nor the wives of your own sons, nor two sisters together at the same time\n—except what was done previously. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful. 24. Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺\ncaptives in your possession.[189] This is Allah’s commandment to you. ˹But˺\nlawful to you are all beyond these—as long as you seek them with your\nwealth in a legal marriage, not in fornication. Give those you have\nconsummated marriage with their due dowries. It is permissible to be\nmutually gracious regarding the set dowry. Surely Allah is All-Knowing,\nAll-Wise.\nMarrying Bondwomen\n25. But if any of you cannot afford to marry a free believing woman, then\n˹let him marry˺ a believing bondwoman possessed by one of you. Allah\nknows best ˹the state of˺ your faith ˹and theirs˺. You are from one another.\n[190] So marry them with the permission of their owners,[191] giving them\ntheir dowry in fairness, if they are chaste, neither promiscuous nor having\nsecret affairs. If they commit indecency after marriage, they receive half the\n\n-- 91 of 694 --\n\npunishment of free women.[192] This is for those of you who fear falling\ninto sin. But if you are patient, it is better for you. And Allah is All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\nAllah’s Grace\n26. It is Allah’s Will to make things clear to you, guide you to the ˹noble˺\nways of those before you, and turn to you in mercy. For Allah is All-\nKnowing, All-Wise. 27. And it is Allah’s Will to turn to you in grace, but\nthose who follow their desires wish to see you deviate entirely ˹from\nAllah’s Way˺. 28. And it is Allah’s Will to lighten your burdens, for\nhumankind was created weak.\nProhibition of Abuse\n29. O believers! Do not devour one another’s wealth illegally, but rather\ntrade by mutual consent. And do not kill ˹each other or˺ yourselves. Surely\nAllah is ever Merciful to you. 30. And whoever does this sinfully and\nunjustly, We will burn them in the Fire. That is easy for Allah.\nAvoiding Major Sins\n31. If you avoid the major sins forbidden to you, We will absolve you of\nyour ˹lesser˺ misdeeds and admit you into a place of honour.[193]\nInheritance Law 5) Contentment\n32. And do not crave what Allah has given some of you over others. Men\nwill be rewarded according to their deeds and women ˹equally˺ according to\ntheirs. Rather, ask Allah for His bounties. Surely Allah has ˹perfect˺\nknowledge of all things. 33. And We have appointed heirs to what has been\nleft by parents and next of kin. As for those you have made a pledge to,\ngive them their share.[194] Surely Allah is a Witness over all things.\nHusbands as Providers and Protectors\n34. Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by\nAllah over women and tasked with supporting them financially. And\nrighteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what\nAllah has entrusted them with.[195] And if you sense ill-conduct from your\nwomen, advise them ˹first˺, ˹if they persist,˺ do not share their beds, ˹but if\nthey still persist,˺ then discipline them ˹gently˺.[196] But if they change their\nways, do not be unjust to them. Surely Allah is Most High, All-Great.\n\n-- 92 of 694 --\n\nReconciling Married Couples\n35. If you anticipate a split between them, appoint a mediator from his\nfamily and another from hers. If they desire reconciliation, Allah will\nrestore harmony between them. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.\nThe Kind, the Stingy, and the Insincere\n36. Worship Allah ˹alone˺ and associate none with Him. And be kind to\nparents, relatives, orphans, the poor, near and distant neighbours, close\nfriends, ˹needy˺ travellers, and those ˹bondspeople˺ in your possession.\nSurely Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful— 37. those who\nare stingy, promote stinginess among people, and withhold Allah’s\nbounties. We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.\n38. Likewise for those who spend their wealth to show off and do not\nbelieve in Allah or the Last Day. And whoever takes Satan as an associate\n—what an evil associate they have!\nDivine Justice\n39. What harm could have come to them if they had believed in Allah and\nthe Last Day and donated from what Allah has provided for them? And\nAllah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of them. 40. Indeed, Allah never wrongs\n˹anyone˺—even by an atom’s weight.[197] And if it is a good deed, He will\nmultiply it many times over and will give a great reward out of His grace.\nWitnesses on Judgment Day\n41. So how will it be when We bring a witness from every faith-community\nand bring you ˹O Prophet˺ as a witness against yours? 42. On that Day,\nthose who denied ˹Allah˺ and disobeyed the Messenger will wish they were\nreduced to dust. And they will never be able to hide anything from Allah.\n[198]\nPurification Before Prayers\n43. O believers! Do not approach prayer while intoxicated[199] until you are\naware of what you say, nor in a state of ˹full˺ impurity[200]—unless you\nmerely pass through ˹the mosque˺—until you have bathed. But if you are ill,\non a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or been intimate with your wives\nand cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean earth, wiping your\nfaces and hands.[201] And Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.\nWarning Against Deviance\n\n-- 93 of 694 --\n\n44. Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who were given a portion of the\nScriptures yet trade it for misguidance and wish to see you deviate from the\n˹Right˺ Path? 45. Allah knows best who your enemies are! And Allah is\nsufficient as a Guardian, and He is sufficient as a Helper.\nHumility with the Prophet[202]\n46. Some Jews take words out of context and say, “We listen and we\ndisobey,” “Hear! May you never hear,” and “Râ’ina!” [Herd us!]—playing\nwith words and discrediting the faith. Had they said ˹courteously˺, “We hear\nand obey,” “Listen to us,” and “Un\nẓurna,” [Tend to us!] it would have been\nbetter for them and more proper. Allah has condemned them for their\ndisbelief, so they do not believe except for a few.\nReward for Rejecting the Truth\n47. O you who were given the Book! Believe in what We have revealed—\nconfirming your own Scriptures—before We wipe out ˹your˺ faces, turning\nthem backwards, or We condemn the defiant as We did to the Sabbath-\nbreakers.[203] And Allah’s command is always executed!\nThe Only Unforgivable Sin\n48. Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him ˹in worship˺,\n[204] but forgives anything else of whoever He wills. And whoever\nassociates others with Allah has indeed committed a grave sin.\nSelf-Righteousness\n49. Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who ˹falsely˺ elevate themselves?\nIt is Allah who elevates whoever He wills. And none will be wronged ˹even\nby the width of˺ the thread of a date stone. 50. See how they fabricate lies\nagainst Allah—this alone is a blatant sin.\nFalse Reassurance\n51. Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who were given a portion of the\nScriptures yet believe in idols and false gods and reassure the\ndisbelievers[205] that they are better guided than the believers? 52. It is they\nwho have been condemned by Allah. And whoever is condemned by Allah\nwill have no helper.\nEnvy Breeds Disbelief\n\n-- 94 of 694 --\n\n53. Do they have control over shares of the kingdom? If so, they would not\nhave given anyone so much as the speck on a date stone. 54. Or do they\nenvy the people for Allah’s bounties? Indeed, We have given the\ndescendants of Abraham the Book and wisdom, along with great authority.\n55. Yet some believed in him while others turned away from him.[206] Hell\nis sufficient as a torment!\nPunishment of the Disbelievers\n56. Surely those who reject Our signs, We will cast them into the Fire.\nWhenever their skin is burnt completely, We will replace it so they will\n˹constantly˺ taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.\nReward of the Believers\n57. As for those who believe and do good, We will admit them into Gardens\nunder which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. There they will\nhave pure spouses,[207] and We will place them under a vast shade.\nMaintaining Justice\n58. Indeed, Allah commands you to return trusts to their rightful owners;\n[208] and when you judge between people, judge with fairness. What a noble\ncommandment from Allah to you! Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.\nDivine Judgment\n59. O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority\namong you. Should you disagree on anything, then refer it to Allah and His\nMessenger, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. This is the best\nand fairest resolution.\nHypocrites Rejecting Divine Judgment\n60. Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who claim they believe in what\nhas been revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They seek the\njudgment of false judges, which they were commanded to reject. And Satan\n˹only˺ desires to lead them farther away. 61. When it is said to them, “Come\nto Allah’s revelations and to the Messenger,” you see the hypocrites turn\naway from you stubbornly. 62. How ˹horrible˺ will it be if a disaster strikes\nthem because of what their hands have done, then they come to you\nswearing by Allah, “We intended nothing but goodwill and reconciliation.”\n63. ˹Only˺ Allah knows what is in their hearts. So turn away from them,\ncaution them, and give them advice that will shake their very souls.\n\n-- 95 of 694 --\n\nObeying the Messenger\n64. We only sent messengers to be obeyed by Allah’s Will. If only those\n˹hypocrites˺ came to you ˹O Prophet˺—after wronging themselves—seeking\nAllah’s forgiveness and the Messenger prayed for their forgiveness, they\nwould have certainly found Allah ever Accepting of Repentance, Most\nMerciful.\nUnconditional Obedience\n65. But no! By your Lord, they will never be ˹true˺ believers until they\naccept you ˹O Prophet˺ as the judge in their disputes, and find no resistance\nwithin themselves against your decision and submit wholeheartedly. 66. If\nWe had commanded them to sacrifice themselves or abandon their homes,\nnone would have obeyed except for a few. Had they done what they were\nadvised to do,[209] it would have certainly been far better for them and more\nreassuring, 67. and We would have granted them a great reward by Our\ngrace 68. and guided them to the Straight Path.\nReward for Obedience\n69. And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger will be in the company of\nthose blessed by Allah: the prophets, the people of truth, the martyrs, and\nthe righteous—what honourable company! 70. This is Allah’s favour, and\nAllah fully knows ˹who deserves it˺.\nAdvice to the Army\n71. O believers! Take your precautions and go forth either in groups or\ntogether. 72. There will be some among you who will lag behind so that if\nyou face a disaster, they will say, “Allah has blessed us for not being there\namong them.” 73. But if you return with Allah’s bounties, they will say—as\nif there had been no bond between you—“We wish we had been there with\nthem to share the great gain!”\nFighting Against Oppression\n74. Let those who would sacrifice this life for the Hereafter fight in the\ncause of Allah. And whoever fights in Allah’s cause—whether they achieve\nmartyrdom or victory—We will honour them with a great reward. 75. And\nwhat is it with you? You do not fight in the cause of Allah and for\noppressed men, women, and children who cry out, “Our Lord! Deliver us\n\n-- 96 of 694 --\n\nfrom this land of oppressors! Appoint for us a saviour; appoint for us a\nhelper—all by Your grace.”\nFighting Satan’s Allies\n76. Believers fight for the cause of Allah, whereas disbelievers fight for the\ncause of the Devil. So fight against Satan’s ˹evil˺ forces. Indeed, Satan’s\nschemes are ever weak.\nThose Who Cower\n77. Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who had been told, “Do not fight!\nRather, establish prayer and pay alms-tax.”? Then once the order came to\nfight, a group of them feared those ˹hostile˺ people as Allah should be\nfeared—or even more. They said, “Our Lord! Why have You ordered us to\nfight? If only You had delayed ˹the order for˺ us for a little while!” Say, ˹O\nProphet,˺ “The enjoyment of this world is so little, whereas the Hereafter is\nfar better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. And none of you will be wronged\n˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone.\nDivine Destiny\n78. Wherever you may be, death will overcome you—even if you were in\nfortified towers.” When something good befalls them, they say, “This is\nfrom Allah,” but when something evil befalls them, they say, “This is from\nyou.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Both have been destined by Allah.” So what is the\nmatter with these people? They can hardly comprehend anything! 79.\nWhatever good befalls you is from Allah and whatever evil befalls you is\nfrom yourself.[210] We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a messenger to ˹all˺\npeople. And Allah is sufficient as a Witness.\nObeying the Messenger\n80. Whoever obeys the Messenger has truly obeyed Allah. But whoever\nturns away, then ˹know that˺ We have not sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a keeper\nover them. 81. And they say, “We obey,” but when they leave you, a group\nof them would spend the night contradicting what they said. Allah records\nall their schemes. So turn away from them, and put your trust in Allah. And\nAllah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.\nReflecting on the Quran\n82. Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other\nthan Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies.\n\n-- 97 of 694 --\n\nSpreading Rumours\n83. And when they hear news of security or fear,[211] they publicize it. Had\nthey referred it to the Messenger or their authorities, those with sound\njudgment among them would have validated it. Had it not been for Allah’s\ngrace and mercy, you would have followed Satan—except for a few.\nShow of Strength\n84. So fight in the cause of Allah ˹O Prophet˺. You are accountable for none\nbut yourself. And motivate the believers ˹to fight˺, so perhaps Allah will\ncurb the disbelievers’ might. And Allah is far superior in might and in\npunishment.\nGood and Evil Intercession\n85. Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share in the reward,\nand whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden.\nAnd Allah is Watchful over all things.\nResponding to Greetings\n86. And when you are greeted, respond with a better greeting or at least\nsimilarly. Surely Allah is a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner of all things.\nAssembly for Judgment Day\n87. Allah, there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He will certainly\ngather ˹all of˺ you together on the Day of Judgment—about which there is\nno doubt. And whose word is more truthful than Allah’s?\nStance on Hypocrites\n88. Why are you ˹believers˺ divided into two groups regarding the\nhypocrites while Allah allowed them to regress ˹to disbelief˺ because of\ntheir misdeeds? Do you wish to guide those left by Allah to stray? And\nwhoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way. 89. They\nwish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be\nalike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of\nAllah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you\nfind them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,[212] 90. except\nthose who are allies of a people you are bound with in a treaty or those\nwholeheartedly opposed to fighting either you or their own people. If Allah\nhad willed, He would have empowered them to fight you. So if they refrain\nfrom fighting you and offer you peace, then Allah does not permit you to\n\n-- 98 of 694 --\n\nharm them. 91. You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their\nown people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺.\nIf they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you,\nthen seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you\nfull permission over such people.\nKilling a Believer Unintentionally\n92. It is not lawful for a believer to kill another except by mistake. And\nwhoever kills a believer unintentionally must free a believing slave and pay\nblood-money to the victim’s family—unless they waive it charitably. But if\nthe victim is a believer from a hostile people, then a believing slave must be\nfreed. And if the victim is from a people bound with you in a treaty, then\nblood-money must be paid to the family along with freeing a believing\nslave. Those who are unable, let them fast two consecutive months—as a\nmeans of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nKilling a Believer Intentionally\n93. And whoever kills a believer intentionally, their reward will be Hell—\nwhere they will stay indefinitely.[213] Allah will be displeased with them,\ncondemn them, and will prepare for them a tremendous punishment.\nRandom Fighting\n94. O believers! When you struggle in the cause of Allah, be sure of who\nyou fight. And do not say to those who offer you ˹greetings of˺ peace, “You\nare no believer!”—seeking a fleeting worldly gain.[214] Instead, Allah has\ninfinite bounties ˹in store˺. You were initially like them then Allah blessed\nyou ˹with Islam˺. So be sure! Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.\nStruggling in Allah’s Cause\n95. Those who stay at home—except those with valid excuses[215]—are not\nequal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their\nlives. Allah has elevated in rank those who strive with their wealth and their\nlives above those who stay behind ˹with valid excuses˺. Allah has promised\neach a fine reward, but those who strive will receive a far better reward than\nothers— 96. far superior ranks, forgiveness, and mercy from Him. And\nAllah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nYielding to Oppression\n\n-- 99 of 694 --\n\n97. When the angels seize the souls of those who have wronged\nthemselves[216]—scolding them, “What do you think you were doing?” they\nwill reply, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will respond, “Was\nAllah’s earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate?” It is they who will\nhave Hell as their home—what an evil destination! 98. Except helpless\nmen, women, and children who cannot afford a way out— 99. it is right to\nhope that Allah will pardon them. For Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-\nForgiving.\nMigrating in Allah’s Cause\n100. Whoever emigrates in the cause of Allah will find many safe havens\nand bountiful resources throughout the earth. Those who leave their homes\nand die while emigrating to Allah and His Messenger—their reward has\nalready been secured with Allah. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful.\nShortening Prayers\n101. When you travel through the land, it is permissible for you to shorten\nthe prayer[217]—˹especially˺ if you fear an attack by the disbelievers.\nIndeed, the disbelievers are your sworn enemies.\nPraying in a State of Fear\n102. When you ˹O Prophet˺ are ˹campaigning˺ with them and you lead them\nin prayer, let one group of them pray with you—while armed. When they\nprostrate themselves, let the other group stand guard behind them. Then the\ngroup that has not yet prayed will then join you in prayer—and let them be\nvigilant and armed.[218] The disbelievers would wish to see you neglect\nyour weapons and belongings, so they could launch a sweeping assault on\nyou. But there is no blame if you lay aside your weapons when overcome\nby heavy rain or illness—but take precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared a\nhumiliating punishment for the disbelievers. 103. When the prayers are\nover, remember Allah—whether you are standing, sitting, or lying down.\nBut when you are secure, establish regular prayers. Indeed, performing\nprayers is a duty on the believers at the appointed times.\nDiligence Against the Enemy\n104. Do not falter in pursuit of the enemy—if you are suffering, they too are\nsuffering. But you can hope to receive from Allah what they can never hope\n\n-- 100 of 694 --\n\nfor. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nJustice to a Jew[219]\n105. Indeed, We have sent down the Book to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth to\njudge between people by means of what Allah has shown you. So do not be\nan advocate for the deceitful. 106. And seek Allah’s forgiveness—indeed,\nAllah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 107. Do not advocate for those who\nwrong themselves.[220] Surely Allah does not like those who are deceitful,\nsinful. 108. They try to hide ˹their deception˺ from people, but they can\nnever hide it from Allah—in Whose presence they plot by night what is\ndispleasing to Him. And Allah is Fully Aware of what they do. 109. Here\nyou are! You ˹believers˺ are advocating for them in this life, but who will\n˹dare to˺ advocate for them before Allah on the Day of Judgment? Or who\nwill come to their defence?\nAfter Sin\n110. Whoever commits evil or wrongs themselves then seeks Allah’s\nforgiveness will certainly find Allah All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 111.\nAnd whoever commits a sin—it is only to their own loss. Allah is All-\nKnowing, All-Wise. 112. And whoever commits an evil or sinful deed then\nblames it on an innocent person, they will definitely bear the guilt of\nslander and blatant sin.\nAllah’s Grace to the Prophet\n113. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy, a group of them would\nhave sought to deceive you ˹O Prophet˺. Yet they would deceive none but\nthemselves, nor can they harm you in the least. Allah has revealed to you\nthe Book and wisdom and taught you what you never knew. Great ˹indeed˺\nis Allah’s favour upon you!\nSecret Talks\n114. There is no good in most of their secret talks—except those\nencouraging charity, kindness, or reconciliation between people. And\nwhoever does this seeking Allah’s pleasure, We will grant them a great\nreward.\nOpposing the Messenger\n115. And whoever defies the Messenger after guidance has become clear to\nthem and follows a path other than that of the believers, We will let them\n\n-- 101 of 694 --\n\npursue what they have chosen, then burn them in Hell—what an evil end!\nUnforgivable Sin\n116. Surely Allah does not forgive associating ˹others˺ with Him ˹in\nworship˺,[221] but forgives anything else of whoever He wills. Indeed,\nwhoever associates ˹others˺ with Allah has clearly gone far astray.\nSatan’s Allies\n117. Instead of Allah, they only invoke female gods[222] and they ˹actually˺\ninvoke none but a rebellious Satan— 118. cursed by Allah—who said, “I\nwill surely take hold of a certain number of Your servants. 119. I will\ncertainly mislead them and delude them with empty hopes. Also, I will\norder them and they will slit the ears of cattle[223] and alter Allah’s\ncreation.” And whoever takes Satan as a guardian instead of Allah has\ncertainly suffered a tremendous loss. 120. Satan only makes them ˹false˺\npromises and deludes them with ˹empty˺ hopes. Truly Satan promises them\nnothing but delusion. 121. It is they who will have Hell as their home, and\nthey will find no escape from it!\nReward of the Believers\n122. And those who believe and do good, We will soon admit them into\nGardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah’s\npromise is ˹always˺ true. And whose word is more truthful than Allah’s?\nDoing, Not Wishing\n123. ˹Divine grace is˺ neither by your wishes nor those of the People of the\nBook! Whoever commits evil will be rewarded accordingly, and they will\nfind no protector or helper besides Allah. 124. But those who do good—\nwhether male or female—and have faith will enter Paradise and will never\nbe wronged ˹even as much as˺ the speck on a date stone.\nAbraham’s Way\n125. And who is better in faith than those who ˹fully˺ submit themselves to\nAllah, do good, and follow the Way of Abraham, the upright? Allah chose\nAbraham as a close friend. 126. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the\nheavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is Fully Aware of\neverything.\nCaring for Female Orphans\n\n-- 102 of 694 --\n\n127. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding women. Say, “It is Allah Who\ninstructs you regarding them. Instruction has ˹already˺ been revealed in the\nBook[224] concerning the orphan women you deprive of their due rights[225]\nbut still wish to marry, also helpless children, as well as standing up for\norphans’ rights. And whatever good you do is certainly well known to\nAllah.”\nReconciling Married Couples\n128. If a woman fears indifference or neglect from her husband, there is no\nblame on either of them if they seek ˹fair˺ settlement, which is best. Humans\nare ever inclined to selfishness.[226] But if you are gracious and mindful ˹of\nAllah˺, surely Allah is All-Aware of what you do.\nMaintaining Justice Among Wives\n129. You will never be able to maintain ˹emotional˺ justice between your\nwives—no matter how keen you are. So do not totally incline towards one\nleaving the other in suspense.[227] And if you do what is right and are\nmindful ˹of Allah˺, surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 130. But if\nthey choose to separate, Allah will enrich both of them from His bounties.\nAnd Allah is Ever-Bountiful, All-Wise.\nAllah’s Might and Grace\n131. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on\nthe earth. Indeed, We have commanded those given the Scripture before\nyou, as well as you, to be mindful of Allah. But if you disobey, then ˹know\nthat˺ to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is\nSelf-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. 132. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in\nthe heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a\nTrustee of Affairs. 133. If it is His Will, He can remove you altogether, O\nhumanity, and replace you with others. And Allah is Most Capable to do so.\n134. Whoever desires the reward of this world, then ˹let them know that˺\nwith Allah are the rewards of this world and the Hereafter. And Allah is\nAll-Hearing, All-Seeing.\nStanding up for Justice\n135. O believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah even if it is\nagainst yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Be they rich or poor,\nAllah is best to ensure their interests. So do not let your desires cause you to\n\n-- 103 of 694 --\n\ndeviate ˹from justice˺. If you distort the testimony or refuse to give it, then\n˹know that˺ Allah is certainly All-Aware of what you do.\nTrue Belief\n136. O believers! Have faith in Allah, His Messenger, the Book He has\nrevealed to His Messenger, and the Scriptures He revealed before. Indeed,\nwhoever denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last\nDay has clearly gone far astray.\nWarning Against Hypocrites\n137. Indeed, those who believed then disbelieved, then believed and again\ndisbelieved—˹only˺ increasing in disbelief—Allah will neither forgive them\nnor guide them to the ˹Right˺ Way. 138. Give good news of a painful\npunishment to hypocrites, 139. who choose disbelievers as allies instead of\nthe believers. Do they seek honour and power through that company?\nSurely all honour and power belongs to Allah.\nShunning Ridiculers\n140. He has already revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah’s\nrevelations being denied or ridiculed, then do not sit in that company unless\nthey engage in a different topic, or else you will be like them.[228] Surely\nAllah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.\nHypocritical Stance\n141. ˹The hypocrites are˺ those who wait to see what happens to you. So if\nAllah grants you victory, they say ˹to you˺, “Were we not on your side?”\nBut if the disbelievers have a share ˹of victory˺, they say ˹to them˺, “Did we\nnot have the advantage over you, yet we protected you from the believers?”\nAllah will judge between ˹all of˺ you on the Day of Judgment. And Allah\nwill never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers.\nQualities of the Hypocrites\n142. Surely the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He outwits them.\nWhen they stand up for prayer, they do it half-heartedly only to be seen by\npeople—hardly remembering Allah at all. 143. Torn between belief and\ndisbelief—belonging neither to these ˹believers˺ nor those ˹disbelievers˺.\nAnd whoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way.\nUnacceptable Guardianship\n\n-- 104 of 694 --\n\n144. O believers! Do not take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers.\nWould you like to give Allah solid proof against yourselves?\nReward of Hypocrites\n145. Surely the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire—and you\nwill never find for them any helper— 146. except those who repent, mend\ntheir ways, hold fast to Allah, and are sincere in their devotion to Allah;\nthey will be with the believers. And Allah will grant the believers a great\nreward. 147. Why should Allah punish you if you are grateful and faithful?\nAllah is ever Appreciative, All-Knowing.\nNegativity in Public\n148. Allah does not like negative thoughts to be voiced—except by those\nwho have been wronged.[229] Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 149.\nWhether you reveal or conceal a good or pardon an evil—surely Allah is\nEver-Pardoning, Most Capable.\nFaith in All Prophets\n150. Surely those who deny Allah and His messengers and wish to make a\ndistinction between Allah and His messengers,[230] saying, “We believe in\nsome and disbelieve in others,” desiring to forge a compromise, 151. they\nare indeed the true disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers\na humiliating punishment. 152. As for those who believe in Allah and His\nmessengers—accepting all; rejecting none—He will surely give them their\nrewards. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nMoses and the Children of Israel\n153. The People of the Book demand that you ˹O Prophet˺ bring down for\nthem a revelation in writing from heaven.[231] They demanded what is even\ngreater than this from Moses, saying, “Make Allah visible to us!” So a\nthunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf for\nworship after receiving clear signs. Still We forgave them for that ˹after\ntheir repentance˺ and gave Moses compelling proof. 154. We raised the\nMount over them ˹as a warning˺ for ˹breaking˺ their covenant and said,\n“Enter the gate ˹of Jerusalem˺ with humility.” We also warned them, “Do\nnot break the Sabbath,” and took from them a firm covenant.\nFalsehood About Mary and Jesus\n\n-- 105 of 694 --\n\n155. ˹They were condemned˺ for breaking their covenant, rejecting Allah’s\nsigns, killing the prophets unjustly, and for saying, “Our hearts are\nunreceptive!”[232]—it is Allah Who has sealed their hearts for their\ndisbelief, so they do not believe except for a few— 156. and for their denial\nand outrageous accusation against Mary,[233] 157. and for boasting, “We\nkilled the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” But they\nneither killed nor crucified him—it was only made to appear so.[234] Even\nthose who argue for this ˹crucifixion˺ are in doubt. They have no knowledge\nwhatsoever—only making assumptions. They certainly did not kill him.\n158. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty, All-\nWise. 159. Every one of the People of the Book will definitely believe in\nhim before his death.[235] And on the Day of Judgment Jesus will be a\nwitness against them.\nConsequences of Disobedience\n160. We forbade the Jews certain foods that had been lawful to them for\ntheir wrongdoing, and for hindering many from the Way of Allah, 161.\ntaking interest despite its prohibition, and consuming people’s wealth\nunjustly. We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful\npunishment. 162. But those of them well-grounded in knowledge, the\nfaithful ˹who˺ believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and\nwhat was revealed before you—˹especially˺ those who establish prayer—\nand those who pay alms-tax and believe in Allah and the Last Day, to these\n˹people˺ We will grant a great reward.\nMessengers of Islam\n163. Indeed, We have sent revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ as We sent\nrevelation to Noah and the prophets after him. We also sent revelation to\nAbraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants, ˹as well as˺ Jesus,\nJob, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon. And to David We gave the Psalms. 164.\nThere are messengers whose stories We have told you already and others\nWe have not. And to Moses Allah spoke directly. 165. ˹All were˺\nmessengers delivering good news and warnings so humanity should have\nno excuse before Allah after ˹the coming of˺ the messengers. And Allah is\nAlmighty, All-Wise.\nMu\nḥammad’s Messengership\n\n-- 106 of 694 --\n\n166. Yet ˹if you are denied, O Prophet,˺ Allah bears witness to what He has\nsent down to you—He has sent it with His knowledge. The angels too bear\nwitness. And Allah ˹alone˺ is sufficient as a Witness.\nPunishment for Rejecting the Truth\n167. Those who disbelieve and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah have\ncertainly strayed far away. 168. Those who disbelieve and wrong\nthemselves—surely Allah will neither forgive them nor guide them to any\npath 169. except that of Hell, to stay there for ever and ever. And that is\neasy for Allah.\nUniversality of Islam\n170. O humanity! The Messenger has certainly come to you with the truth\nfrom your Lord, so believe for your own good. But if you disbelieve, then\n˹know that˺ to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And\nAllah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nWake-up Call\n171. O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes regarding your faith; say\nnothing about Allah except the truth.[236] The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary,\nwas no more than a messenger of Allah and the fulfilment of His Word\nthrough Mary and a spirit ˹created by a command˺ from Him.[237] So\nbelieve in Allah and His messengers and do not say, “Trinity.” Stop!—for\nyour own good. Allah is only One God. Glory be to Him! He is far above\nhaving a son! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is\non the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs. 172. The\nMessiah would never be too proud to be a servant of Allah, nor would the\nangels nearest to Allah. Those who are too proud and arrogant to worship\nHim will be brought before Him all together.\nThe Reward\n173. As for those who believe and do good, He will reward them in full and\nincrease them out of His grace. But those who are too proud and arrogant,\nHe will subject them to a painful punishment. And besides Allah they will\nfind no protector or helper.\nUniversal Call to Islam\n174. O humanity! There has come to you conclusive evidence from your\nLord. And We have sent down to you a brilliant light. 175. As for those who\n\n-- 107 of 694 --\n\nbelieve in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into His mercy\nand grace and guide them to Himself through the Straight Path.\nInheritance Law 6) Full Siblings[238]\n176. They ask you ˹for a ruling, O Prophet˺. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling\nregarding those who die without children or parents.” If a man dies\nchildless and leaves behind a sister, she will inherit one-half of his estate,\nwhereas her brother will inherit all of her estate if she dies childless. If this\nperson leaves behind two sisters, they together will inherit two-thirds of the\nestate. But if the deceased leaves male and female siblings, a male’s share\nwill be equal to that of two females. Allah makes ˹this˺ clear to you so you\ndo not go astray. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.[239]\n***\n\n-- 108 of 694 --\n\n5. The Spread Table\n(Al-Mâ'idah)\nThis Medinian sûrah takes its name from the story of the table mentioned in\nverses 112-115. Several rulings are laid out, including permissible and\nprohibited foods, hunting while on pilgrimage, and making a bequest while\ntravelling. A reference is made to Allah’s covenants with the Jews and\nChristians and how those covenants were repeatedly violated. The believers\nare urged to comply with Allah’s judgment as communicated by the Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Some topics that have been touched on in the previous sûrahs are\ndetailed here, including making up for a broken oath, the sanctity of the\nhuman life, and the humanity of Jesus (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nHonouring Obligations\n1. O believers! Honour your obligations. All grazing livestock has been\nmade lawful to you—except what is hereby announced to you and hunting\nwhile on pilgrimage. Indeed, Allah commands what He wills.\nAllah’s Sanctities\n2. O believers! Do not violate Allah’s rituals ˹of pilgrimage˺, the sacred\nmonths, the sacrificial animals, the ˹offerings decorated with˺ garlands, nor\nthose ˹pilgrims˺ on their way to the Sacred House seeking their Lord’s\nbounty and pleasure. When pilgrimage has ended, you are allowed to hunt.\nDo not let the hatred of a people who once barred you from the Sacred\nMosque provoke you to transgress. Cooperate with one another in goodness\nand righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And be\nmindful of Allah. Surely Allah is severe in punishment.\nForbidden Foods\n3. Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, and swine; what is slaughtered in the\nname of any other than Allah; what is killed by strangling, beating, a fall, or\nby being gored to death; what is partly eaten by a predator unless you\nslaughter it; and what is sacrificed on altars. You are also forbidden to draw\nlots for decisions.[240] This is all evil. Today the disbelievers have given up\n\n-- 109 of 694 --\n\nall hope of ˹undermining˺ your faith. So do not fear them; fear Me! Today I\nhave perfected your faith for you, completed My favour upon you, and\nchosen Islam as your way. But whoever is compelled by extreme hunger—\nnot intending to sin—then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nLawful Foods\n4. They ask you, ˹O Prophet,˺ what is permissible for them ˹to eat˺. Say,\n“What is good and lawful. Also what is caught by your hunting animals and\nbirds of prey which you have trained as instructed by Allah. So eat what\nthey catch for you, but mention the Name of Allah over it ˹first˺.” And be\nmindful of Allah. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.\nWhat to Eat and Who to Marry\n5. Today all good, pure foods have been made lawful for you. Similarly, the\nfood of the People of the Book[241] is permissible for you and yours is\npermissible for them. And ˹permissible for you in marriage˺ are chaste\nbelieving women as well as chaste women of those given the Scripture\nbefore you—as long as you pay them their dowries in wedlock, neither\nfornicating nor taking them as mistresses. And whoever rejects the faith, all\ntheir good deeds will be void ˹in this life˺ and in the Hereafter they will be\namong the losers.\nPurification Before Prayer\n6. O believers! When you rise up for prayer, wash your faces and your\nhands up to the elbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet to the ankles.\nAnd if you are in a state of ˹full˺ impurity,[242] then take a full bath. But if\nyou are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or have been intimate\nwith your wives and cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean\nearth by wiping your faces and hands.[243] It is not Allah’s Will to burden\nyou, but to purify you and complete His favour upon you, so perhaps you\nwill be grateful.\nAllah’s Favour to the Believers\n7. Remember Allah’s favour upon you and the covenant He made with you\nwhen you said, “We hear and obey.” And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah\nknows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.\nBe Just\n\n-- 110 of 694 --\n\n8. O believers! Stand firm for Allah and bear true testimony. Do not let the\nhatred of a people lead you to injustice. Be just! That is closer to\nrighteousness. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what\nyou do.\nReward of Belief and Disbelief\n9. Allah has promised those who believe and do good ˹His˺ forgiveness and\na great reward. 10. As for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they\nare the residents of the Hellfire.\nBelievers Saved from Harm\n11. O believers! Remember Allah’s favour upon you: when a people sought\nto harm you, but He held their hands back from you. Be mindful of Allah.\nAnd in Allah let the believers put their trust.\nAllah’s Covenant with the Israelites\n12. Allah made a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve\nleaders from among them and ˹then˺ said, “I am truly with you. If you\nestablish prayer, pay alms-tax, believe in My messengers, support them, and\nlend to Allah a good loan, I will certainly forgive your sins and admit you\ninto Gardens under which rivers flow. And whoever among you disbelieves\nafterwards has truly strayed from the Right Way.”\nThe Covenant Is Broken\n13. But for breaking their covenant, We condemned them and hardened\ntheir hearts. They distorted the words of the Scripture and neglected a\nportion of what they had been commanded to uphold. You ˹O Prophet˺ will\nalways find deceit on their part, except for a few. But pardon them and bear\nwith them. Indeed, Allah loves the good-doers.\nCovenant with Christians Broken Too\n14. And from those who say, “We are Christians,” We took their covenant,\nbut they neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold.\nSo We let hostility and enmity arise between them until the Day of\nJudgment, and soon Allah will inform them of all they have done.\nThe Prophet’s Mission\n15. O People of the Book! Now Our Messenger has come to you, revealing\nmuch of what you have hidden of the Scriptures and disregarding much.\nThere certainly has come to you from Allah a light and a clear Book 16.\n\n-- 111 of 694 --\n\nthrough which Allah guides those who seek His pleasure to the ways of\npeace, brings them out of darkness and into light by His Will, and guides\nthem to the Straight Path.\nJesus Is Not Allah\n17. Indeed, those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have fallen\ninto disbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has the power to prevent Allah if He\nchose to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, his mother, and everyone in the\nworld all together?” To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens\nand the earth and everything in between. He creates whatever He wills. And\nAllah is Most Capable of everything.\nChildren of Allah?\n18. The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of Allah and\nHis most beloved!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Why then does He punish you for\nyour sins? No! You are only humans like others of His Own making. He\nforgives whoever He wills and punishes whoever He wills. To Allah ˹alone˺\nbelongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in\nbetween. And to Him is the final return.”\nNo Excuse\n19. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has indeed come to you, making\nthings clear to you after an interval between the messengers so you do not\nsay, “There has never come to us a deliverer of good news or a warner.”\nNow there has come to you a deliverer of good news and a warner. And\nAllah is Most Capable of everything.\nThe Israelites Ordered to Enter the Holy Land\n20. And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people!\nRemember Allah’s favours upon you when He raised prophets from among\nyou, made you sovereign,[244] and gave you what He had never given\nanyone in the world.[245] 21. O my people! Enter the Holy Land which\nAllah has destined for you ˹to enter˺. And do not turn back or else you will\nbecome losers.” 22. They replied, “O Moses! There is an enormously\npowerful people there, so we will never ˹be able to˺ enter it until they leave.\nIf they do, then we will enter!” 23. Two God-fearing men—who had been\nblessed by Allah—said, “Surprise them through the gate. If you do, you will\ncertainly prevail. Put your trust in Allah if you are ˹truly˺ believers.” 24.\n\n-- 112 of 694 --\n\n˹Yet˺ they said, “O Moses! ˹Still˺ we will never enter as long as they remain\nthere. So go—both you and your Lord—and fight; we are staying right\nhere!”\nForty Years in the Wilderness\n25. Moses pleaded, “My Lord! I have no control over anyone except myself\nand my brother. So set us apart from the rebellious people.” 26. Allah\nreplied, “Then this land is forbidden to them for forty years, during which\nthey will wander through the land. So do not grieve for the rebellious\npeople.”\nAbel and Cain[246]\n27. Relate to them in truth ˹O Prophet˺ the story of Adam’s two sons—how\neach offered a sacrifice: Abel’s offering was accepted while Cain’s was not.\nSo Cain threatened, “I will kill you!” His brother replied, “Allah only\naccepts ˹the offering˺ of the sincerely devout. 28. If you raise your hand to\nkill me, I will not raise mine to kill you, because I fear Allah—the Lord of\nall worlds. 29. I want to let you bear your sin against me along with your\nother sins, then you will be one of those destined to the Fire. And that is the\nreward of the wrongdoers.” 30. Yet Cain convinced himself to kill his\nbrother, so he killed him—becoming a loser. 31. Then Allah sent a crow\ndigging ˹a grave˺ in the ground ˹for a dead crow˺, in order to show him how\nto bury the corpse of his brother. He cried, “Alas! Have I ˹even˺ failed to be\nlike this crow and bury the corpse of my brother?” So he became regretful.\n[247]\nValue of Human Life\n32. That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a\nlife—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be\nas if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if\nthey saved all of humanity.[248] ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to\nthem with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through\nthe land.\nAnti-Terrorism Law\n33. Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His\nMessenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off\ntheir hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land. This ˹penalty˺\n\n-- 113 of 694 --\n\nis a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous\npunishment in the Hereafter.[249] 34. As for those who repent before you\nseize them, then know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nCloser to Allah\n35. O believers! Be mindful of Allah and seek what brings you closer to\nHim and struggle in His Way, so you may be successful.\nReward of the Disbelievers\n36. As for the disbelievers, even if they were to possess everything in the\nworld twice over ˹and offer it all˺ to ransom themselves from the\npunishment of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted from them.\nAnd they will suffer a painful punishment. 37. They will be desperate to get\nout of the Fire but they will never be able to. And they will suffer an\neverlasting punishment.\nPunishment of Theft\n38. As for male and female thieves, cut off their hands for what they have\ndone—a deterrent from Allah. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.[250] 39.\nBut whoever repents after their wrongdoing and mends their ways, Allah\nwill surely turn to them in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful.\nAllah’s Might and Grace\n40. Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs\nto Allah ˹alone˺? He punishes whoever He wills and forgives whoever He\nwills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.\nDo Not Be Disheartened\n41. O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those\nwho say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief.\nNor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who\nare too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings\nout of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺,\naccept it. If not, beware!” Whoever Allah allows to be deluded, you can\nnever be of any help to them against Allah. It is not Allah’s Will to purify\ntheir hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a\ntremendous punishment in the Hereafter.\nFair Judgment\n\n-- 114 of 694 --\n\n42. They eagerly listen to falsehood and consume forbidden gain.[251] So if\nthey come to you ˹O Prophet˺, either judge between them or turn away from\nthem. If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you whatsoever. But if\nyou judge between them, then do so with justice. Surely Allah loves those\nwho are just. 43. But why do they come to you for judgment when they\n˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away\nafter all? They are not ˹true˺ believers.\nJudging by the Torah\n44. Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which\nthe prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews.\nSo too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah’s Book, with\nwhich they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. So do not\nfear the people; fear Me! Nor trade my revelations for a fleeting gain. And\nthose who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the\ndisbelievers.\nJustice System\n45. We ordained for them in the Torah, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a\nnose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth—and for wounds equal\nretaliation.” But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for\nthem. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺\nthe wrongdoers.\nJudging by the Gospel\n46. Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary,\nconfirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel\ncontaining guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the\nTorah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing. 47. So let the people of the\nGospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge\nby what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.\nJudging by the Quran\n48. We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ this Book with the truth, as a\nconfirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So\njudge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their\ndesires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have\nordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would\n\n-- 115 of 694 --\n\nhave made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has\ngiven ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah\nyou will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your\ndifferences.\nAllah’s Judgment\n49. And judge between them ˹O Prophet˺ by what Allah has revealed, and\ndo not follow their desires. And beware, so they do not lure you away from\nsome of what Allah has revealed to you. If they turn away ˹from Allah’s\njudgment˺, then know that it is Allah’s Will to repay them for some of their\nsins, and that many people are indeed rebellious. 50. Is it the judgment of\n˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance they seek? Who could be a better judge than Allah\nfor people of sure faith?\nHypocrites’ Guardians\n51. O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as guardians—they are\nguardians of each other.[252] Whoever does so will be counted as one of\nthem. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. 52. You see\nthose with sickness in their hearts racing for their guardianship, saying ˹in\njustification˺, “We fear a turn of fortune will strike us.” But perhaps Allah\nwill bring about ˹your˺ victory or another favour by His command, and they\nwill regret what they have hidden in their hearts. 53. ˹Only then,˺ the\nbelievers will ask ˹one another˺, “Are these the ones who swore solemn\noaths by Allah that they were with you?” Their deeds have been in vain, so\nthey have become losers.\nTrue Believers\n54. O believers! Whoever among you abandons their faith, Allah will\nreplace them with others who love Him and are loved by Him. They will be\nhumble with the believers but firm towards the disbelievers, struggling in\nthe Way of Allah; fearing no blame from anyone. This is the favour of\nAllah. He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-\nKnowing.\nTrue Guardianship\n55. Your only guardians are Allah, His Messenger, and fellow believers—\nwho establish prayer and pay alms-tax with humility. 56. Whoever allies\n\n-- 116 of 694 --\n\nthemselves with Allah, His Messenger, and fellow believers, then it is\ncertainly Allah’s party that will prevail.\nUnacceptable Guardianship\n57. O believers! Do not seek the guardianship of those given the Scripture\nbefore you and the disbelievers who have made your faith a mockery and\namusement. And be mindful of Allah if you are ˹truly˺ believers. 58. When\nyou call to prayer, they mock it in amusement. This is because they are a\npeople without understanding.\nWho Deserves Resentment?\n59. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! Do you resent us only because\nwe believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was\nrevealed before—while most of you are rebellious?” 60. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Shall I inform you of those who deserve a worse punishment from Allah\n˹than the rebellious˺? It is those who earned Allah’s condemnation and\ndispleasure—some being reduced to apes and pigs[253] and worshippers of\nfalse gods. These are far worse in rank and farther astray from the Right\nWay.”\nHypocrites Among Jews\n61. When they come to you ˹believers˺ they say, “We believe.” But they are\ncommitted to disbelief when they enter and when they leave. And Allah\nknows what they hide. 62. You see many of them racing towards sin,\ntransgression, and consumption of forbidden gain. Evil indeed are their\nactions! 63. Why do their rabbis and scholars not forbid them from saying\nwhat is sinful and consuming what is unlawful? Evil indeed is their\ninaction!\nAllah Is Ever Generous\n64. ˹Some among˺ the Jews said, “Allah is tight-fisted.”[254] May their fists\nbe tied and they be condemned for what they said. Rather, He is open-\nhanded, giving freely as He pleases. That which has been revealed to you\n˹O Prophet˺ from your Lord will only cause many of them to increase in\nwickedness and disbelief. We have stirred among them hostility and hatred\nuntil the Day of Judgment. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah puts\nit out. And they strive to spread corruption in the land. And Allah does not\nlike corruptors.\n\n-- 117 of 694 --\n\nWorst of Both Worlds\n65. Had the People of the Book only been faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺,\nWe would have certainly absolved them of their sins and admitted them into\nthe Gardens of Bliss. 66. And had they observed the Torah, the Gospel, and\nwhat has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would have been\noverwhelmed with provisions from above and below. Some among them are\nupright, yet many do nothing but evil.\nA Messenger’s Duty Is to Convey\n67. O Messenger! Convey everything revealed to you from your Lord. If\nyou do not, then you have not delivered His message. Allah will ˹certainly˺\nprotect you from the people. Indeed, Allah does not guide the people who\ndisbelieve.\nAdherence to Scriptures\n68. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on\nunless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to\nyou from your Lord.” And your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ will\nonly cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. So do not\ngrieve for the people who disbelieve.\nTrue Belief in Allah\n69. Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians[255] and Christians—whoever\n˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there will be no\nfear for them, nor will they grieve.\nThe Israelites Rejecting Messengers\n70. Indeed, We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them\nmessengers. Whenever a messenger came to them with what they did not\ndesire, they denied some and killed others. 71. They thought there would be\nno consequences, so they turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. Yet Allah turned\nto them in forgiveness ˹after their repentance˺, but again many became blind\nand deaf. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.\nOne God, Not Three\n72. Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly\nfallen into disbelief. The Messiah ˹himself˺ said, “O Children of Israel!\nWorship Allah—my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever associates others with\nAllah ˹in worship˺ will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home\n\n-- 118 of 694 --\n\nwill be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers. 73. Those who\nsay, “Allah is one in a Trinity,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. There is\nonly One God. If they do not stop saying this, those who disbelieve among\nthem will be afflicted with a painful punishment.\nStill Not Too Late\n74. Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness? And\nAllah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nJesus Was Human, Not Divine\n75. The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. ˹Many˺\nmessengers had ˹come and˺ gone before him. His mother was a woman of\ntruth. They both ate food.[256] See how We make the signs clear to them, yet\nsee how they are deluded ˹from the truth˺!\nFollow the Truth\n76. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How can you worship besides Allah those who can\nneither harm nor benefit you? And Allah ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-\nKnowing.” 77. Say, “O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes in your\nfaith beyond the truth, nor follow the vain desires of those who went astray\nbefore ˹you˺. They misled many and strayed from the Right Way.”\nEvildoers Among the Israelites\n78. The disbelievers among the Children of Israel were condemned in the\nrevelations of David and Jesus, son of Mary. That was for their\ndisobedience and violations. 79. They did not forbid one another from\ndoing evil. Evil indeed was what they did! 80. You see many of them taking\nthe disbelievers[257] as allies. Truly wicked are their misdeeds, which have\nearned them Allah’s wrath. And they will be in everlasting torment. 81. Had\nthey believed in Allah, the Prophet, and what has been revealed to him, they\nwould have never taken those ˹pagans˺ as allies. But most of them are\nrebellious.\nThose Most Gracious Towards Believers\n82. You will surely find the most bitter towards the believers to be the Jews\nand polytheists and the most gracious to be those who call themselves\nChristian. That is because there are priests and monks among them and\nbecause they are not arrogant. 83. When they listen to what has been\nrevealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears for\n\n-- 119 of 694 --\n\nrecognizing the truth. They say, “Our Lord! We believe, so count us among\nthe witnesses. 84. Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has\ncome to us? And we long for our Lord to include us in the company of the\nrighteous.” 85. So Allah will reward them for what they said with Gardens\nunder which rivers flow, to stay there forever. And that is the reward of the\ngood-doers. 86. As for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, they will\nbe the residents of the Hellfire.\nBe Moderate\n87. O believers! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful\nfor you, and do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors. 88.\nEat of the good, lawful things provided to you by Allah. And be mindful of\nAllah in Whom you believe.\nBroken Oaths\n89. Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He\nwill hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken\noath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own\nfamily, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is\naffordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking\nyour oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes things\nclear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful.\nForbidden Items\n90. O believers! Intoxicants, gambling, idols, and drawing lots for\ndecisions[258] are all evil of Satan’s handiwork. So shun them so you may\nbe successful. 91. Satan’s plan is to stir up hostility and hatred between you\nwith intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from remembering Allah\nand praying. Will you not then abstain? 92. Obey Allah and obey the\nMessenger and beware! But if you turn away, then know that Our\nMessenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.\nThe Past Is Forgiven\n93. There is no blame on those who believe and do good for what they had\nconsumed before ˹the prohibition˺, as long as they fear Allah, have faith,\nand do what is good; then they believe and act virtuously, then become fully\nmindful ˹of Allah˺ and do righteous deeds. For Allah loves the good-doers.\nHunting While on Pilgrimage\n\n-- 120 of 694 --\n\n94. O believers! Allah will surely test you with game within the reach of\nyour hands and spears to distinguish those who fear Him in secret. Whoever\ntransgresses from now on will suffer a painful punishment. 95. O believers!\nDo not kill game while on pilgrimage. Whoever kills game intentionally\nmust compensate by offering its equivalence—as judged by two just men\namong you—to be offered at the Sacred House, or by feeding the needy, or\nby fasting so that they may taste the consequences of their violations. Allah\nhas forgiven what has been done. But those who persist will be punished by\nAllah. And Allah is Almighty, capable of punishment.\nSeafood Is Lawful\n96. It is lawful for you to hunt and eat seafood, as a provision for you and\nfor travellers. But hunting on land is forbidden to you while on pilgrimage.\nBe mindful of Allah to Whom you all will be gathered.\nPilgrimage Symbols\n97. Allah has made the Ka’bah—the Sacred House—a sanctuary of well-\nbeing for all people, along with the sacred months, the sacrificial animals,\nand the ˹offerings decorated with˺ garlands. All this so you may know that\nAllah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and\nthat He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of everything. 98. Know that Allah is\nsevere in punishment and that He is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 99. The\nMessenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows\nwhat you reveal and what you conceal.\nGood and Evil Not Equal\n100. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Good and evil are not equal, though you may be\ndazzled by the abundance of evil. So be mindful of Allah, O people of\nreason, so you may be successful.”\nUnnecessary Questions[259]\n101. O believers! Do not ask about any matter which, if made clear to you,\nmay disturb you. But if you inquire about what is being revealed in the\nQuran, it will be made clear to you. Allah has forgiven what was done ˹in\nthe past˺.[260] And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. 102. Some\npeople before you asked such questions then denied their answers.\nCamels Dedicated to Idols\n\n-- 121 of 694 --\n\n103. Allah has never ordained the ˹so-called˺ baḥîrah, sâ'ibah, wa\nṣîlah, and\nḥâm camels.[261] But the disbelievers[262] just fabricate lies about Allah,\nand most of them lack understanding. 104. When it is said to them, “Come\nto Allah’s revelations and to the Messenger,” they reply, “What we found\nour forefathers practicing is good enough for us.” ˹Would they still do so,˺\neven if their forefathers had absolutely no knowledge or guidance?\nEveryone Accountable for Themselves\n105. O believers! You are accountable only for yourselves.[263] It will not\nharm you if someone chooses to deviate—as long as you are ˹rightly˺\nguided. To Allah you will all return, and He will inform you of what you\nused to do.\nVerifying Bequests\n106. O believers! When death approaches any of you, call upon two just\nMuslim men to witness as you make a bequest; otherwise, two non-\nMuslims if you are afflicted with death while on a journey.[264] If you doubt\n˹their testimony˺, keep them after prayer and let them testify under oath\n˹saying˺, “By Allah! We would never sell our testimony for any price, even\nin favour of a close relative, nor withhold the testimony of Allah.\nOtherwise, we would surely be sinful.” 107. If they are found guilty ˹of\nfalse testimony˺, let the deceased’s two closest heirs affected by the bequest\nreplace the witnesses and testify under oath ˹saying˺, “By Allah! Our\ntestimony is truer than theirs. We have not transgressed. Otherwise, we\nwould surely be wrongdoers.” 108. In this way it is more likely that\nwitnesses will give true testimony or else fear that their oaths could be\nrefuted by those of the heirs. Be mindful of Allah and obey. For Allah does\nnot guide the rebellious people.\nAllah Asking the Messengers\n109. ˹Consider˺ the Day Allah will gather the messengers and say, “What\nresponse did you receive?” They will reply, “We have no knowledge\n˹compared to You˺! You ˹alone˺ are indeed the Knower of all unseen.”\nAllah’s Favours upon Jesus\n110. And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary!\nRemember My favour upon you and your mother: how I supported you\nwith the holy spirit[265] so you spoke to people in ˹your˺ infancy and\n\n-- 122 of 694 --\n\nadulthood. How I taught you writing, wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel.\nHow you moulded a bird from clay—by My Will—and breathed into it and\nit became a ˹real˺ bird—by My Will. How you healed the blind and the\nlepers—by My Will. How you brought the dead to life—by My Will. How I\nprevented the Children of Israel from harming you when you came to them\nwith clear proofs and the disbelievers among them said, “This is nothing but\npure magic.” 111. And how I inspired the disciples, “Believe in Me and My\nmessenger!” They declared, “We believe and bear witness that we fully\nsubmit ˹to Allah˺.”[266]\nMiracle of the Table\n112. ˹Remember˺ when the disciples asked, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Would\nyour Lord be willing to send down to us a table spread with food from\nheaven?” Jesus answered, “Fear Allah if you are ˹truly˺ believers.” 113.\nThey said, “We ˹only˺ wish to eat from it to reassure our hearts, to verify\nyou are indeed truthful to us, and to become its witnesses.” 114. Jesus, son\nof Mary, prayed, “O Allah, our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread\nwith food as a feast for us—the first and last of us—and as a sign from You.\nProvide for us! You are indeed the Best Provider.” 115. Allah answered, “I\nam sending it down to you. But whoever among you denies afterwards will\nbe subjected to a torment I have never inflicted on anyone of My creation.”\nJesus Denying Claim to Divinity\n116. And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did\nyou ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides\nAllah?” He will answer, “Glory be to You! How could I ever say what I had\nno right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known\nit. You know what is ˹hidden˺ within me, but I do not know what is within\nYou. Indeed, You ˹alone˺ are the Knower of all unseen. 117. I never told\nthem anything except what You ordered me to say: “Worship Allah—my\nLord and your Lord!” And I was witness over them as long as I remained\namong them. But when You took me,[267] You were the Witness over them\n—and You are a Witness over all things. 118. If You punish them, they\nbelong to You after all.[268] But if You forgive them, You are surely the\nAlmighty, All-Wise.” 119. Allah will declare, “This is the Day when ˹only˺\nthe faithful will benefit from their faithfulness. Theirs are Gardens under\nwhich rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with\n\n-- 123 of 694 --\n\nthem and they are pleased with Him. That is the ultimate triumph.” 120. To\nAllah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and\neverything within. And He is Most Capable of everything.\n***\n\n-- 124 of 694 --\n\n6. Cattle\n(Al-An’âm)\nLike the previous sûrah, this Meccan sûrah masterfully demonstrates\nAllah’s power and knowledge, and thoroughly refutes pagan beliefs and\nunfounded practices, including animal offerings to the idols. Permissible\nand prohibited foods are explained in more detail than in the previous\nsûrah. The nature of prophethood is defined, making it clear that\nmessengers cannot do anything without the Will of Allah. This sûrah begins\nby highlighting Allah’s authority, just like the ending of the previous sûrah,\nand concludes by emphasizing accountability for one’s deeds, just like the\nbeginning of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nRejecting the Almighty\n1. All praise is for Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and made\ndarkness and light.[269] Yet the disbelievers set up equals to their Lord ˹in\nworship˺. 2. He is the One Who created you from clay,[270] then appointed a\nterm ˹for your death˺ and another known only to Him ˹for your resurrection˺\n—yet you continue to doubt! 3. He is the Only True God in the heavens and\nthe earth. He knows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal, and\nknows whatever you do.\nTaking Allah’s Signs Lightly\n4. Whenever a sign comes to them from their Lord, they turn away from it.\n5. They have indeed rejected the truth when it came to them, so they will\nsoon face the consequences of their ridicule.\nFate of the Deniers\n6. Have they not seen how many ˹disbelieving˺ peoples We destroyed\nbefore them? We had made them more established in the land than you. We\nsent down abundant rain for them and made rivers flow at their feet. Then\nWe destroyed them for their sins and replaced them with other peoples.\nDemanding Written Scripture[271]\n\n-- 125 of 694 --\n\n7. Had We sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ a revelation in writing and they\nwere to touch it with their own hands, the disbelievers would still have said,\n“This is nothing but pure magic!”\nDemanding to See an Angel\n8. They say, “Why has no ˹visible˺ angel come with him?” Had We sent\ndown an angel, the matter would have certainly been settled ˹at once˺,[272]\nand they would have never been given more time ˹to repent˺. 9. And if We\nhad sent an angel, We would have certainly made it ˹assume the form of˺ a\nman—leaving them more confused than they already are.\nFate of the Ridiculers\n10. ˹Other˺ messengers had already been ridiculed before you ˹O Prophet˺,\nbut those who mocked them were overtaken by what they used to ridicule.\n11. Say, “Travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers.”\nAllah Almighty\n12. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “To whom belongs everything in the heavens\nand the earth?” Say, “To Allah!” He has taken upon Himself to be Merciful.\nHe will certainly gather ˹all of˺ you together for the Day of Judgment—\nabout which there is no doubt. But those who have ruined themselves will\nnever believe. 13. To Him belongs whatever exists in the day and night.\nAnd He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\nAllah Is the Guardian\n14. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Will I take any guardian other than Allah, the\nOriginator of the heavens and the earth, Who provides for all and is not in\nneed of provision?” Say, “I have been commanded to be the first to submit\nand not be one of the polytheists.” 15. Say, “I truly fear—if I were to\ndisobey my Lord—the torment of a tremendous Day.” 16. Whoever is\nspared the torment of that Day will have certainly been shown Allah’s\nmercy. And that is the absolute triumph.\nAllah Reigns Supreme\n17. If Allah touches you with harm, none can undo it except Him. And if\nHe touches you with a blessing, He is Most Capable of everything. 18. He\nreigns supreme over His creation. And He is the All-Wise, All-Aware.\nAllah Is the Best Witness\n\n-- 126 of 694 --\n\n19. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who is the best witness?” Say, “Allah is! He is\na Witness between me and you. And this Quran has been revealed to me so\nthat, with it, I may warn you and whoever it reaches. Do you ˹pagans˺\ntestify that there are other gods besides Allah?” ˹Then˺ say, “I will never\ntestify ˹to this˺!” ˹And˺ say, “There is only One God. And I totally reject\nwhatever ˹idols˺ you associate with Him.”\nRecognizing the Prophet\n20. Those to whom We gave the Scripture recognize him ˹to be a true\nprophet˺ as they recognize their own children. Those who have ruined\nthemselves will never believe. 21. Who does more wrong than those who\nfabricate lies against Allah or deny His signs? Indeed, the wrongdoers will\nnever succeed.\nThe Polytheists\n22. ˹Consider˺ the Day We will gather them all together then ask those who\nassociated others ˹with Allah in worship˺, “Where are those gods you used\nto claim?” 23. Their only argument will be: “By Allah, our Lord! We were\nnever polytheists.” 24. See how they will lie about themselves and how\nthose ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them!\nDisbelievers Turning Away\n25. There are some of them who ˹pretend to˺ listen to your recitation ˹of the\nQuran˺, but We have cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to\ncomprehend it—and deafness in their ears. Even if they were to see every\nsign, they still would not believe in them. The disbelievers would ˹even˺\ncome to argue with you, saying, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but ancient\nfables!” 26. They turn others away from the Prophet and distance\nthemselves as well. They ruin none but themselves, yet they fail to perceive\nit.\nHorrified by the Fire\n27. If only you could see when they will be detained before the Fire! They\nwill cry, “Oh! If only we could be sent back, we would never deny the signs\nof our Lord and we would ˹surely˺ be of the believers.” 28. But no! ˹They\nonly say this˺ because the truth they used to hide will become all too clear\nto them. Even if they were to be sent back, they would certainly revert to\nwhat they were forbidden. Indeed they are liars!\n\n-- 127 of 694 --\n\nDeniers of the Hereafter\n29. They insisted, “There is nothing beyond this worldly life and we will\nnever be resurrected.” 30. But if only you could see when they will be\ndetained before their Lord! He will ask ˹them˺, “Is this ˹Hereafter˺ not the\ntruth?” They will cry, “Absolutely, by our Lord!” He will say, “Then taste\nthe punishment for your disbelief.” 31. Losers indeed are those who deny\nthe meeting with Allah until the Hour takes them by surprise, then they will\ncry, “Woe to us for having ignored this!” They will bear ˹the burden of˺\ntheir sins on their backs. Evil indeed is their burden!\nFleeting Enjoyment\n32. This worldly life is no more than play and amusement, but far better is\nthe ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you\nnot then understand?\nNot the First Rejected Prophet\n33. We certainly know that what they say grieves you ˹O Prophet˺. It is not\nyour honesty they question—it is Allah’s signs that the wrongdoers deny.\n34. Indeed, messengers before you were rejected but patiently endured\nrejection and persecution until Our help came to them. And Allah’s promise\n˹to help˺ is never broken. And you have already received some of the\nnarratives of these messengers.\nDisbelievers, No Matter What\n35. If you find their denial unbearable, then build—if you can—a tunnel\nthrough the earth or stairs to the sky to bring them a ˹more compelling˺\nsign. Had Allah so willed, He could have guided them all. So do not be one\nof those ignorant ˹of this fact˺.\nDeaf to the Truth\n36. Only the attentive will respond ˹to your call˺. As for the dead, Allah will\nraise them up, then to Him they will ˹all˺ be returned. 37. They ask, “Why\nhas no ˹other˺ sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Allah certainly has the power to send down a sign”—though most of them\ndo not know.\nThe Animal Kingdom\n38. All living beings roaming the earth and winged birds soaring in the sky\nare communities like yourselves.[273] We have left nothing out of the\n\n-- 128 of 694 --\n\nRecord.[274] Then to their Lord they will be gathered all together.\nGuidance Is from Allah Only\n39. Those who deny Our signs are ˹wilfully˺ deaf and dumb—lost in\ndarkness. Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He\nwills to the Straight Way.\nAllah Alone Removes Hardships\n40. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Imagine if you were overwhelmed by Allah’s\ntorment or the Hour—would you call upon any other than Allah ˹for help˺?\n˹Answer me˺ if your claims are true! 41. No! He is the only One you would\ncall. And if He willed, He could remove the affliction that made you invoke\nHim. Only then will you forget whatever you associate with Him ˹in\nworship˺.”\nDeniers’ Gradual Destruction\n42. Indeed, We have sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ to other\npeople who We put through suffering and adversity ˹for their denial˺, so\nperhaps they would be humbled. 43. Why did they not humble themselves\nwhen We made them suffer? Instead, their hearts were hardened, and Satan\nmade their misdeeds appealing to them. 44. When they became oblivious to\nwarnings, We showered them with everything they desired. But just as they\nbecame prideful of what they were given, We seized them by surprise, then\nthey instantly fell into despair! 45. So the wrongdoers were utterly\nuprooted. And all praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds.\nOnly Allah Can Relieve Affliction\n46. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Imagine if Allah were to take away your\nhearing or sight, or seal your hearts—who else other than Allah could\nrestore it?” See ˹O Prophet˺ how We vary the signs, yet they still turn away.\n47. Ask, “Imagine if Allah’s punishment were to overwhelm you with or\nwithout warning—who would be destroyed other than the wrongdoers?”\nThe Messengers’ Duty\n48. We have sent messengers only as deliverers of good news and as\nwarners. Whoever believes and does good, there will be no fear for them,\nnor will they grieve. 49. But those who deny Our signs will be afflicted with\npunishment for their rebelliousness.\nNo More than a Prophet\n\n-- 129 of 694 --\n\n50. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not say to you that I possess Allah’s treasuries or\nknow the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel. I only follow what is\nrevealed to me.” Say, “Are those blind ˹to the truth˺ equal to those who can\nsee? Will you not then reflect?”\nThe Quran as a Warning\n51. Warn with this ˹Quran˺ those who are awed by the prospect of being\ngathered before their Lord—when they will have no protector or intercessor\nbesides Him—so perhaps they will be mindful ˹of Him˺.\nInfluential Meccans vs. Poor Believers[275]\n52. ˹O Prophet!˺ Do not dismiss those ˹poor believers˺ who invoke their\nLord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure.[276] You are not\naccountable for them whatsoever, nor are they accountable for you. So do\nnot dismiss them, or you will be one of the wrongdoers. 53. In this way We\nhave tested some by means of others, so those ˹disbelievers˺ may say, “Has\nAllah favoured these ˹poor believers˺ out of all of us?” Does Allah not best\nrecognize the grateful? 54. When the believers in Our revelations come to\nyou, say, “Peace be upon you! Your Lord has taken upon Himself to be\nMerciful. Whoever among you commits evil ignorantly ˹or recklessly˺ then\nrepents afterwards and mends their ways, then Allah is truly All-Forgiving,\nMost Merciful.” 55. This is how We make Our signs clear, so the way of the\nwicked may become distinct.\nOnly One God\n56. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have been forbidden to worship those you invoke\nbesides Allah.” Say, “I will not follow your desires, for I then would\ncertainly be astray and not one of those ˹rightly˺ guided.”\nDesperate to Be Destroyed\n57. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, I stand on a clear proof from my Lord—yet\nyou have denied it. That ˹torment˺ you seek to hasten is not within my\npower. It is only Allah Who decides ˹its time˺. He declares the truth. And\nHe is the Best of Judges.” 58. Say ˹also˺, “If what you seek to hasten were\nwithin my power, the matter between us would have already been settled.\nBut Allah knows the wrongdoers best.”\nAllah’s Infinite Knowledge\n\n-- 130 of 694 --\n\n59. With Him are the keys of the unseen—no one knows them except Him.\n[277] And He knows what is in the land and sea. Not even a leaf falls without\nHis knowledge, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth or anything—green\nor dry—but is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record.[278]\nSleep: The Twin Brother of Death\n60. He is the One Who calls back your souls by night and knows what you\ndo by day, then revives you daily to complete your appointed term. To Him\nis your ˹ultimate˺ return, then He will inform you of what you used to do.\n61. He reigns supreme over all of His creation, and sends recording-angels,\nwatching over you. When death comes to any of you, Our angels take their\nsoul, never neglecting this duty. 62. Then they are ˹all˺ returned to Allah—\ntheir True Master. Judgment is His ˹alone˺. And He is the Swiftest\nReckoner.\nAllah’s Power\n63. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who rescues you from the darkest times on land and\nat sea? He ˹alone˺ you call upon with humility, openly and secretly: “If You\nrescue us from this, we will be ever grateful.” 64. Say, “˹Only˺ Allah\nrescues you from this and any other distress, yet you associate others with\nHim ˹in worship˺.” 65. Say, “He ˹alone˺ has the power to unleash upon you\na torment from above or below you or split you into ˹conflicting˺ factions\nand make you taste the violence of one another.” See how We vary the\nsigns, so perhaps they will comprehend.\nDeniers of the Truth\n66. Still your people ˹O Prophet˺ have rejected this ˹Quran˺, although it is\nthe truth. Say, “I am not a keeper over you.” 67. Every ˹destined˺ matter has\na ˹set˺ time to transpire. And you will soon come to know.\nMockers of the Quran\n68. And when you come across those who ridicule Our revelations, do not\nsit with them unless they engage in a different topic. Should Satan make\nyou forget, then once you remember, do not ˹continue to˺ sit with the\nwrongdoing people. 69. Those mindful ˹of Allah˺ will not be accountable\nfor those ˹who ridicule it˺ whatsoever—their duty is to advise, so perhaps\nthe ridiculers will abstain.\nWay to Salvation\n\n-- 131 of 694 --\n\n70. And leave those who take this[279] faith ˹of Islam˺ as mere play and\namusement and are deluded by ˹their˺ worldly life. Yet remind them by this\n˹Quran˺, so no one should be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have no\nprotector or intercessor other than Allah. Even if they were to offer every\n˹possible˺ ransom, none will be accepted from them. Those are the ones\nwho will be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have a boiling drink and\npainful punishment for their disbelief.\nAlmighty Allah\n71. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Should we invoke, other than Allah, those\n˹idols˺ which cannot benefit or harm us, and turn back to disbelief after\nAllah has guided us? ˹If we do so, we will be˺ like those disoriented by\ndevils in the wilderness, while their companions call them to guidance,\n˹saying˺, ‘Come to us!’ Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah’s guidance is the ˹only˺\ntrue guidance. And we are commanded to submit to the Lord of all worlds,\n72. establish prayer, and be mindful of Him. To Him you will all be\ngathered together. 73. He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth\nin truth. On the Day ˹of Judgment˺ He will say, ‘Be!’ And there will be! His\ncommand is truth. All authority is His ˹alone˺[280] on the Day the Trumpet\nwill be blown.[281] He is the Knower of all—seen or unseen. And He is the\nAll-Wise, All-Aware.”\nAbraham Corrects His Father\n74. And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said to his father, Ȃzar, “Do you take\nidols as gods? It is clear to me that you and your people are entirely\nmisguided.”\nAbraham Refutes Celestial Worship\n75. We also showed Abraham the wonders of the heavens and the earth, so\nhe would be sure in faith. 76. When the night grew dark upon him, he saw a\nstar and said, “This is my Lord!” But when it set, he said, “I do not love\nthings that set.” 77. Then when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This one\nis my Lord!” But when it disappeared, he said, “If my Lord does not guide\nme, I will certainly be one of the misguided people.” 78. Then when he saw\nthe sun shining, he said, “This must be my Lord—it is the greatest!” But\nagain when it set, he declared, “O my people! I totally reject whatever you\nassociate ˹with Allah in worship˺. 79. I have turned my face towards the\n\n-- 132 of 694 --\n\nOne Who has originated the heavens and the earth—being upright—and I\nam not one of the polytheists.”\nAbraham Debates His People\n80. And his people argued with him. He responded, “Are you arguing with\nme about Allah, while He has guided me? I am not afraid of whatever\n˹idols˺ you associate with Him—˹none can harm me,˺ unless my Lord so\nwills. My Lord encompasses everything in ˹His˺ knowledge. Will you not\nbe mindful? 81. And how should I fear your associate-gods, while you have\nno fear in associating ˹others˺ with Allah—a practice He has never\nauthorized? Which side has more right to security? ˹Tell me˺ if you really\nknow!” 82. It is ˹only˺ those who are faithful and do not tarnish their faith\nwith falsehood[282] who are guaranteed security and are ˹rightly˺ guided. 83.\nThis was the argument We gave Abraham against his people. We elevate in\nrank whoever We please. Surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.\nAbraham and Other Noble Prophets\n84. And We blessed him with Isaac and Jacob. We guided them all as We\npreviously guided Noah and those among his descendants: David, Solomon,\nJob, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. This is how We reward the good-doers. 85.\nLikewise, ˹We guided˺ Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias, who were all of\nthe righteous. 86. ˹We also guided˺ Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot,\nfavouring each over other people ˹of their time˺. 87. And ˹We favoured˺\nsome of their forefathers, their descendants, and their brothers. We chose\nthem and guided them to the Straight Path.\nProphetic Guidance\n88. This is Allah’s guidance with which He guides whoever He wills of His\nservants. Had they associated others with Him ˹in worship˺, their ˹good˺\ndeeds would have been wasted. 89. Those were the ones to whom We gave\nthe Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood. But if these ˹pagans˺ disbelieve in\nthis ˹message˺, then We have already entrusted it to a people who will never\ndisbelieve in it.[283] 90. These ˹prophets˺ were ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah, so\nfollow their guidance. Say, “I ask no reward of you for this ˹Quran˺—it is a\nreminder to the whole world.”\nScriptures Denied\n\n-- 133 of 694 --\n\n91. And they[284] have not shown Allah His proper reverence when they\nsaid, “Allah has revealed nothing to any human being.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Who then revealed the Book brought forth by Moses as a light and\nguidance for people, which you split into separate sheets—revealing some\nand hiding much? You have been taught ˹through this Quran˺ what neither\nyou nor your forefathers knew.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah ˹revealed it˺!”\nThen leave them to amuse themselves with falsehood.\nQuran for All\n92. This is a blessed Book which We have revealed—confirming what came\nbefore it—so you may warn the Mother of Cities[285] and everyone around\nit. Those who believe in the Hereafter ˹truly˺ believe in it and guard their\nprayers.\nFate of the Wicked\n93. Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah or\nclaims, “I have received revelations!”—although nothing was revealed to\nthem—or the one who says, “I can reveal the like of Allah’s revelations!”?\nIf you ˹O Prophet˺ could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death\nwhile the angels are stretching out their hands ˹saying˺, “Give up your\nsouls! Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for telling\nlies about Allah and for being arrogant towards His revelations!” 94.\n˹Today˺ you have come back to Us all alone as We created you the first time\n—leaving behind everything We have provided you with. We do not see\nyour intercessors with you—those you claimed were Allah’s partners ˹in\nworship˺. All your ties have been broken and all your claims have let you\ndown.”\nAllah’s Power of Creation\n95. Indeed, Allah is the One Who causes seeds and fruit stones to sprout.\nHe brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. That\nis Allah! How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺? 96. He causes the\ndawn to break, and has made the night for rest and ˹made˺ the sun and the\nmoon ˹to travel˺ with precision. That is the design of the Almighty, All-\nKnowing. 97. And He is the One Who has made the stars as your guide\nthrough the darkness of land and sea. We have already made the signs clear\nfor people who know. 98. And He is the One Who originated you all from a\n\n-- 134 of 694 --\n\nsingle soul,[286] then assigned you a place to live and another to ˹be laid to˺\nrest. We have already made the signs clear for people who comprehend. 99.\nAnd He is the One Who sends down rain from the sky—causing all kinds of\nplants to grow—producing green stalks from which We bring forth\nclustered grain. And from palm trees come clusters of dates hanging within\nreach. ˹There are˺ also gardens of grapevines, olives, and pomegranates,\nsimilar ˹in shape˺ but dissimilar ˹in taste˺. Look at their fruit as it yields and\nripens! Indeed, in these are signs for people who believe.\nAllah Has No Children\n100. Yet they associate the jinn[287] with Allah ˹in worship˺, even though He\ncreated them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons[288] and daughters[289]\nout of ignorance. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they claim! 101.\n˹He is˺ the Originator of the heavens and earth. How could He have children\nwhen He has no mate? He created all things and has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of\neverything.\nWorship Allah Alone\n102. That is Allah—your Lord! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except\nHim. ˹He is˺ the Creator of all things, so worship Him ˹alone˺. And He is\nthe Maintainer of everything. 103. No vision can encompass Him, but He\nencompasses all vision. For He is the Most Subtle, All-Aware.[290]\nCall to Humanity\n104. Indeed, there have come to you insights from your Lord. So whoever\nchooses to see, it is for their own good. But whoever chooses to be blind, it\nis to their own loss. And I am not a keeper over you. 105. And so We vary\nour signs to the extent that they will say, “You have studied ˹previous\nscriptures˺,”[291] and We make this ˹Quran˺ clear for people who know.\nGuidance Is from Allah Alone\n106. ˹O Prophet!˺ Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord—there is\nno god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—and turn away from the\npolytheists. 107. Had Allah willed, they would not have been polytheists.\nWe have not appointed you as their keeper, nor are you their maintainer.\nAllah Is the Judge\n108. ˹O believers!˺ Do not insult what they invoke besides Allah or they\nwill insult Allah spitefully out of ignorance. This is how We have made\n\n-- 135 of 694 --\n\neach people’s deeds appealing to them. Then to their Lord is their return,\nand He will inform them of what they used to do.\nSigns of No Use\n109. They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a sign were to\ncome to them, they would certainly believe in it. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Signs\nare only with Allah.” What will make you ˹believers˺ realize that even if a\nsign were to come to them, they still would not believe? 110. We turn their\nhearts and eyes away ˹from the truth˺ as they refused to believe at first,\nleaving them to wander blindly in their defiance. 111. Even if We had sent\nthem the angels, made the dead speak to them, and assembled before their\nown eyes every sign ˹they demanded˺, they still would not have believed—\nunless Allah so willed. But most of them are ignorant ˹of this˺.\nThe Deception\n112. And so We have made for every prophet enemies—devilish humans\nand jinn—whispering to one another with elegant words of deception. Had\nit been your Lord’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave\nthem and their deceit, 113. so that the hearts of those who disbelieve in the\nHereafter may be receptive to it, be pleased with it, and be persistent in\ntheir evil pursuits.\nThe Perfect Book\n114. ˹Say, O Prophet,˺ “Should I seek a judge other than Allah while He is\nthe One Who has revealed for you the Book ˹with the truth˺ perfectly\nexplained?” Those who were given the Scripture know that it has been\nrevealed ˹to you˺ from your Lord in truth. So do not be one of those who\ndoubt. 115. The Word of your Lord has been perfected in truth and justice.\nNone can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearing, All- Knowing.\nMost Are Deviant\n116. ˹O Prophet!˺ If you were to obey most of those on earth, they would\nlead you away from Allah’s Way. They follow nothing but assumptions and\ndo nothing but lie. 117. Indeed, your Lord knows best who has strayed from\nHis Way and who is ˹rightly˺ guided.\nLawful and Unlawful Meat\n118. So eat only of what is slaughtered in Allah’s Name if you truly believe\nin His revelations. 119. Why should you not eat of what is slaughtered in\n\n-- 136 of 694 --\n\nAllah’s Name when He has already explained to you what He has forbidden\nto you—except when compelled by necessity? Many ˹deviants˺ certainly\nmislead others by their whims out of ignorance. Surely your Lord knows\nthe transgressors best. 120. Shun all sin—open and secret. Indeed, those\nwho commit sin will be punished for what they earn. 121. Do not eat of\nwhat is not slaughtered in Allah’s Name. For that would certainly be ˹an act\nof˺ disobedience. Surely the devils whisper to their ˹human˺ associates to\nargue with you.[292] If you were to obey them, then you ˹too˺ would be\npolytheists.\nMetaphor for Believers and Disbelievers\n122. Can those who had been dead, to whom We gave life and a light with\nwhich they can walk among people, be compared to those in complete\ndarkness from which they can never emerge?[293] That is how the misdeeds\nof the disbelievers have been made appealing to them. 123. And so We have\nplaced in every society the most wicked to conspire in it. Yet they plot only\nagainst themselves, but they fail to perceive it.\nCraving Prophethood\n124. Whenever a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until\nwe receive what Allah’s messengers received.” Allah knows best where to\nplace His message. The wicked will soon be overwhelmed by humiliation\nfrom Allah and a severe punishment for their evil plots.\nOpen and Restricted Hearts\n125. Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam.[294] But\nwhoever He wills to leave astray, He makes their chest tight and constricted\nas if they were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah dooms those\nwho disbelieve. 126. That is your Lord’s Path—perfectly straight. We have\nalready made the signs clear to those who are mindful. 127. They will have\nthe Home of Peace with their Lord, Who will be their Guardian because of\nwhat they used to do.\nHumans and Jinn on Judgment Day\n128. ˹Consider˺ the Day He will gather them ˹all˺ together and say, “O\nassembly of jinn! You misled humans in great numbers.” And their human\nassociates will say, “Our Lord! We benefited from each other’s company,\n[295] but now we have reached the term which You appointed for us.” ˹Then˺\n\n-- 137 of 694 --\n\nHe will say, “The Fire is your home, yours to stay in forever, except\nwhoever Allah wills to spare.”[296] Surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-\nKnowing. 129. This is how We make the wrongdoers ˹destructive˺ allies of\none another because of their misdeeds.\nConfession of Evil Humans and Jinn\n130. ˹Allah will ask,˺ “O assembly of jinn and humans! Did messengers not\ncome from among you, proclaiming My revelations and warning you of the\ncoming of this Day of yours?” They will say, “We confess against\nourselves!” For they have been deluded by ˹their˺ worldly life. And they\nwill testify against themselves that they were disbelievers. 131. This\n˹sending of the messengers˺ is because your Lord would never destroy a\nsociety for their wrongdoing while its people are unaware ˹of the truth˺.\nThe Good and the Evil\n132. They will each be assigned ranks according to their deeds. And your\nLord is not unaware of what they do.\nAllah Is Not in Need of His Creation\n133. Your Lord is the Self-Sufficient, Full of Mercy. If He wills, He can do\naway with you and replace you with whoever He wills, just as He produced\nyou from the offspring of other people. 134. Indeed, what you have been\npromised will certainly come to pass. And you will have no escape.\nWarning to Meccan Pagans\n135. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O my people! Persist in your ways, for I ˹too˺ will\npersist in mine. You will soon know who will fare best in the end. Indeed,\nthe wrongdoers will never succeed.”\nUnfair Giving[297]\n136. The pagans set aside for Allah a share of the crops and cattle He\ncreated, saying, “This ˹portion˺ is for Allah,” so they claim, “and this ˹one˺\nfor our associate-gods.” Yet the portion of their associate-gods is not shared\nwith Allah while Allah’s portion is shared with their associate-gods. What\nunfair judgment!\nSelf-Destruction[298]\n137. Likewise, the pagans’ evil associates have made it appealing to them\nto kill their own children—only leading to their destruction as well as\n\n-- 138 of 694 --\n\nconfusion in their faith. Had it been Allah’s Will, they would not have done\nsuch a thing. So leave them and their falsehood.\nIdols’ Share in Cattle and Crops\n138. They say, “These cattle and crops are reserved—none may eat them\nexcept those we permit,” so they claim. Some other cattle are exempted\nfrom labour and others are not slaughtered in Allah’s Name—falsely\nattributing lies to Him. He will repay them for their lies. 139. They ˹also˺\nsay, “The offspring of this cattle is reserved for our males and forbidden to\nour females; but if it is stillborn, they may all share it.” He will repay them\nfor their falsehood. Surely He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.\nLost in Ignorance\n140. Lost indeed are those who have murdered their own children foolishly\nout of ignorance and have forbidden what Allah has provided for them—\nfalsely attributing lies to Allah. They have certainly strayed and are not\n˹rightly˺ guided.\nAllah’s Bounties\n141. He is the One Who produces gardens—both cultivated and wild[299]—\nand palm trees, crops of different flavours, olives, and pomegranates—\nsimilar ˹in shape˺, but dissimilar ˹in taste˺. Eat from the fruit they bear and\npay the dues at harvest, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the\nwasteful.\nFour Pairs of Cattle, Male and Female[300]\n142. Some cattle are fit for labour, others are too small.[301] Eat of what\nAllah has provided for you and do not follow Satan’s footsteps. Certainly,\nhe is your sworn enemy. 143. ˹Allah has created˺ four pairs: a pair of sheep\nand a pair of goats—ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Has He forbidden ˹to you˺ the\ntwo males or the two females or what is in the wombs of the two females?\nTell me with knowledge, if what you say is true.”— 144. and a pair of\ncamels and a pair of oxen. Ask ˹them˺, “Has He forbidden ˹to you˺ the two\nmales or the two females or what is in the wombs of the two females? Or\nwere you present when Allah gave you this commandment?” Who does\nmore wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah to mislead others\nwithout ˹any˺ knowledge? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing\npeople.\n\n-- 139 of 694 --\n\nMeat Forbidden to Muslims\n145. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not find in what has been revealed to me\nanything forbidden to eat except carrion, running blood, swine—which is\nimpure—or a sinful offering in the name of any other than Allah. But if\nsomeone is compelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding\nimmediate need—then surely your Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”\nMeat Forbidden to Jews\n146. For those who are Jewish, We forbade every animal with undivided\nhoofs and the fat of oxen and sheep except what is joined to their backs or\nintestines or mixed with bone. In this way We rewarded them for their\nviolations. And We are certainly truthful. 147. But if they deny you ˹O\nProphet˺, say, “Your Lord is infinite in mercy, yet His punishment will not\nbe averted from the wicked people.”\nFree Choice\n148. The polytheists will argue, “Had it been Allah’s Will, neither we nor\nour forefathers would have associated others with Him ˹in worship˺ or made\nanything unlawful.” Likewise, those before them rejected the truth until\nthey tasted Our punishment. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Do you have any\nknowledge that you can produce for us? Surely you follow nothing but\n˹false˺ assumptions and you do nothing but lie.” 149. Say, “Allah has the\nmost conclusive argument. Had it been His Will, He would have easily\nimposed guidance upon all of you.” 150. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Bring your\nwitnesses who can testify that Allah has forbidden this.” If they ˹falsely˺\ntestify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the desires of those who\ndeny Our proofs, disbelieve in the Hereafter, and set up equals with their\nLord.\nAllah’s Commandments\n151. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Come! Let me recite to you what your Lord has\nforbidden to you: do not associate others with Him ˹in worship˺. ˹Do not fail\nto˺ honour your parents. Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We\nprovide for you and for them. Do not come near indecencies, openly or\nsecretly. Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with\n˹legal˺ right.[302] This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will\nunderstand. 152. And do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless\nintending to enhance it—until they attain maturity. Give full measure and\n\n-- 140 of 694 --\n\nweigh with justice. We never require of any soul more than what it can\nafford. Whenever you speak,[303] maintain justice—even regarding a close\nrelative. And fulfil your covenant with Allah. This is what He has\ncommanded you, so perhaps you will be mindful. 153. Indeed, that is My\nPath—perfectly straight. So follow it and do not follow other ways, for they\nwill lead you away from His Way. This is what He has commanded you, so\nperhaps you will be conscious ˹of Allah˺.”\nThe Torah\n154. Additionally, We gave Moses the Scripture, completing the favour\nupon those who do good, detailing everything, and as a guide and a mercy,\nso perhaps they would be certain of the meeting with their Lord.\nThe Quran\n155. This is a blessed Book We have revealed. So follow it and be mindful\n˹of Allah˺, so you may be shown mercy. 156. You ˹pagans˺ can no longer\nsay, “Scriptures were only revealed to two groups before us and we were\nunaware of their teachings.” 157. Nor can you say, “If only the Scriptures\nhad been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.” Now\nthere has come to you from your Lord a clear proof[304]—a guide and\nmercy. Who then does more wrong than those who deny Allah’s revelations\nand turn away from them? We will reward those who turn away from Our\nrevelations with a dreadful punishment for turning away.\nWaiting for the Apocalypse?\n158. Are they awaiting the coming of the angels, or your Lord ˹Himself˺, or\nsome of your Lord’s ˹major˺ signs? On the Day your Lord’s signs arrive,\nbelief will not benefit those who did not believe earlier or those who did no\ngood through their faith.[305] Say, “Keep waiting! We too are waiting.”\nNot Responsible\n159. Indeed, you ˹O Prophet˺ are not responsible whatsoever for those who\nhave divided their faith and split into sects. Their judgment rests only with\nAllah. And He will inform them of what they used to do.\nReward for Good and Evil Deeds\n160. Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded tenfold. But\nwhoever comes with a bad deed will be punished for only one. None will be\nwronged.\n\n-- 141 of 694 --\n\nWay of Life\n161. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely my Lord has guided me to the Straight Path,\na perfect way, the faith of Abraham, the upright, who was not one of the\npolytheists.” 162. Say, “Surely my prayer, my worship, my life, and my\ndeath are all for Allah—Lord of all worlds. 163. He has no partner. So I am\ncommanded, and so I am the first to submit.”\nDivine Justice\n164. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Should I seek a lord other than Allah while He is\nthe Lord of everything?” No one will reap except what they sow. No soul\nburdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is\nyour return, and He will inform you of your differences.\nTest of Life\n165. He is the One Who has placed you as successors on earth and elevated\nsome of you in rank over others, so He may test you with what He has\ngiven you. Surely your Lord is swift in punishment, but He is certainly All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\n***\n\n-- 142 of 694 --\n\n7. The Heights\n(Al-A’râf)\nThis sûrah takes its name from the heights mentioned in verse 46. Like\nmany other Meccan sûrahs, it recounts the stories of earlier prophets who\nwere denied by their own people and how the deniers were eventually\ndestroyed. As mentioned in the previous sûrah (6:10-11), these stories are\nmeant to reassure the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and warn his people of Allah’s\ntorment. The story of Satan’s arrogance and Adam’s temptation and fall are\ndetailed, along with lessons for the believers to beware of Satan’s whispers.\nDetails about Paradise and Hell (verses 36-53) here are unmatched by any\nprevious sûrah. The powerlessness of idols is further emphasized. Full\nobedience to Allah and His prophets is stressed in this sûrah and the next.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAdvice to the Prophet\n1. Alif-Lãm-Mĩm-\nṢãd. 2. ˹This is˺ a Book sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺—\ndo not let anxiety into your heart regarding it—so with it you may warn ˹the\ndisbelievers˺, and as a reminder to the believers.\nAdvice to Humanity\n3. Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not take\nothers as guardians besides Him. How seldom are you mindful! 4.\n˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed! Our torment took them\nby surprise ˹while sleeping˺ at night or midday. 5. Their only cry—when\noverwhelmed by Our torment—was, “We have indeed been wrongdoers.”\nResponse to Messengers\n6. We will surely question those who received messengers and We will\nquestion the messengers ˹themselves˺. 7. Then We will give them a full\naccount with sure knowledge—for We were never absent.\nWeighing Deeds on Judgment Day\n8. The weighing on that Day will be just. As for those whose scale will be\nheavy ˹with good deeds˺, ˹only˺ they will be successful. 9. But those whose\n\n-- 143 of 694 --\n\nscale is light, they have doomed themselves for wrongfully denying Our\nsigns.\nSatan’s Arrogance\n10. We have indeed established you on earth and provided you with a\nmeans of livelihood. ˹Yet˺ you seldom give any thanks. 11. Surely We\ncreated you,[306] then shaped you, then said to the angels, “Prostrate before\nAdam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,[307] who refused to prostrate with the\nothers. 12. Allah asked, “What prevented you from prostrating when I\ncommanded you?” He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from\nfire and him from clay.” 13. Allah said, “Then get down from Paradise! It is\nnot for you to be arrogant here. So get out! You are truly one of the\ndisgraced.” 14. He appealed, “Then delay my end until the Day of their\nresurrection.” 15. Allah said, “You are delayed ˹until the appointed\nDay˺.”[308] 16. He said, “For leaving me to stray I will lie in ambush for\nthem on Your Straight Path. 17. I will approach them from their front, their\nback, their right, their left, and then You will find most of them ungrateful.”\n18. Allah said, “Get out of Paradise! You are disgraced and rejected! I will\ncertainly fill up Hell with you and your followers all together.”\nAdam and Eve: Temptation and Fall\n19. ˹Allah said,˺ “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat from\nwherever you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be\nwrongdoers.” 20. Then Satan tempted them in order to expose what was\nhidden of their nakedness. He said, “Your Lord has forbidden this tree to\nyou only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.” 21. And he\nswore to them, “I am truly your sincere advisor.” 22. So he brought about\ntheir fall through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their\nnakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with\nleaves from Paradise. Then their Lord called out to them, “Did I not forbid\nyou from that tree and ˹did I not˺ tell you that Satan is your sworn enemy?”\n23. They replied, “Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not\nforgive us and have mercy on us, we will certainly be losers.” 24. Allah\nsaid, “Descend as enemies to each other.[309] You will find in the earth a\nresidence and provision for your appointed stay.” 25. He added, “There you\nwill live, there you will die, and from there you will be resurrected.”\n\n-- 144 of 694 --\n\nBest Clothing\n26. O children of Adam! We have provided for you clothing to cover your\nnakedness and as an adornment. However, the best clothing is\nrighteousness. This is one of Allah’s bounties, so perhaps you will be\nmindful.\nWarning Against Satan\n27. O children of Adam! Do not let Satan deceive you as he tempted your\nparents out of Paradise and caused their cover to be removed in order to\nexpose their nakedness. Surely he and his soldiers watch you from where\nyou cannot see them. We have made the devils allies of those who\ndisbelieve. 28. Whenever they commit a shameful deed,[310] they say, “We\nfound our forefathers doing it and Allah has commanded us to do it.” Say,\n“No! Allah never commands what is shameful. How can you attribute to\nAllah what you do not know?” 29. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord has\ncommanded uprightness and dedication ˹to Him alone˺ in worship, calling\nupon Him with sincere devotion. Just as He first brought you into being,\nyou will be brought to life again.” 30. He has guided some, while others are\ndestined to stray. They have taken devils as their masters instead of Allah—\nthinking they are ˹rightly˺ guided.\nThe Lawful and the Forbidden\n31. O Children of Adam! Dress properly whenever you are at worship. Eat\nand drink, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the wasteful. 32. Ask,\n˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has forbidden the adornments and lawful provisions\nAllah has brought forth for His servants?” Say, “They are for the enjoyment\nof the believers in this worldly life, but they will be exclusively theirs on\nthe Day of Judgment.[311] This is how We make Our revelations clear for\npeople of knowledge.” 33. Say, “My Lord has only forbidden open and\nsecret indecencies, sinfulness, unjust aggression, associating ˹others˺ with\nAllah ˹in worship˺—a practice He has never authorized—and attributing to\nAllah what you do not know.” 34. For each community there is an\nappointed term. When their time arrives, they can neither delay it for a\nmoment, nor could they advance it.\nReceiving the Truth\n\n-- 145 of 694 --\n\n35. O children of Adam! When messengers from among yourselves come to\nyou reciting My revelations—whoever shuns evil and mends their ways,\nthere will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. 36. But those who\nreceive Our revelations with denial and arrogance will be the residents of\nthe Fire. They will be there forever.\nEvil Leaders and Their Followers\n37. Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah or\ndeny His revelations? They will receive what is destined for them,[312] until\nOur messenger-angels arrive to take their souls, asking them, “Where are\nthose ˹false gods˺ you used to invoke besides Allah?” They will cry, “They\nhave failed us,” and they will confess against themselves that they were\nindeed disbelievers. 38. Allah will say, “Enter the Fire along with the ˹evil˺\ngroups of jinn and humans that preceded you.” Whenever a group enters\nHell, it will curse the preceding one until they are all gathered inside, the\nfollowers will say about their leaders, “Our Lord! They have misled us, so\nmultiply their torment in the Fire.” He will answer, “It has already been\nmultiplied for all, but you do not know.” 39. Then the leaders will say to\ntheir followers, “You were no better than us! So taste the torment for what\nyou used to commit.”\nPunishment of the Disbelievers\n40. Surely those who receive our revelations with denial and arrogance, the\ngates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise\nuntil a camel passes through the eye of a needle. This is how We reward the\nwicked. 41. Hell will be their bed; flames will be their cover. This is how\nWe reward the wrongdoers.\nReward of the Believers\n42. As for those who believe and do good—We never require of any soul\nmore than what it can afford—it is they who will be the residents of\nParadise. They will be there forever. 43. We will remove whatever\nbitterness they had in their hearts.[313] Rivers will flow under their feet. And\nthey will say, “Praise be to Allah for guiding us to this. We would have\nnever been guided if Allah had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord\nhad certainly come with the truth.” It will be announced to them, “This is\nParadise awarded to you for what you used to do.”\n\n-- 146 of 694 --\n\nThe Lord’s Promise\n44. The residents of Paradise will call out to the residents of the Fire, “We\nhave certainly found our Lord’s promise to be true. Have you too found\nyour Lord’s promise to be true?” They will reply, “Yes, we have!” Then a\ncaller will announce to both, “May Allah’s condemnation be upon the\nwrongdoers, 45. those who hindered ˹others˺ from Allah’s Way, strived to\nmake it ˹appear˺ crooked, and disbelieved in the Hereafter.”\nPeople on the Heights[314]\n46. There will be a barrier between Paradise and Hell. And on the heights\n˹of that barrier˺ will be people[315] who will recognize ˹the residents of˺ both\nby their appearance.[316] They will call out to the residents of Paradise,\n“Peace be upon you!” They will have not yet entered Paradise, but eagerly\nhope to. 47. When their eyes will turn towards the residents of Hell, they\nwill pray, “Our Lord! Do not join us with the wrongdoing people.” 48.\nThose on the heights will call out to some ˹tyrants in the Fire˺, who they\nwill recognize by their appearance, saying, “Your large numbers and\narrogance are of no use ˹today˺! 49. Are these ˹humble believers˺ the ones\nyou swore would never be shown Allah’s mercy?” ˹Finally, those on the\nheights will be told:˺ “Enter Paradise! There will be no fear for you, nor will\nyou grieve.”\nDisbelievers Begging Believers\n50. The residents of the Fire will then cry out to the residents of Paradise,\n“Aid us with some water or any provision Allah has granted you.” They\nwill reply, “Allah has forbidden both to the disbelievers, 51. those who took\nthis[317] faith ˹of Islam˺ as mere amusement and play and were deluded by\n˹their˺ worldly life.” ˹Allah will say,˺ “Today We will ignore them just as\nthey ignored the coming of this Day of theirs and for rejecting Our\nrevelations.”\nToo Late\n52. We have certainly brought them a Book which We explained with\nknowledge—a guide and mercy for those who believe. 53. Do they only\nawait the fulfilment ˹of its warning˺? The Day it will be fulfilled, those who\nignored it before will say, “The messengers of our Lord certainly came with\nthe truth. Are there any intercessors who can plead on our behalf? Or can\n\n-- 147 of 694 --\n\nwe be sent back so we may do ˹good,˺ unlike what we used to do?” They\nwill have certainly ruined themselves, and whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated\nwill fail them.\nThe Almighty Creator\n54. Indeed your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six\nDays,[318] then established Himself on the Throne. He makes the day and\nnight overlap in rapid succession. He created the sun, the moon, and the\nstars—all subjected by His command. The creation and the command\nbelong to Him ˹alone˺. Blessed is Allah—Lord of all worlds! 55. Call upon\nyour Lord humbly and secretly. Surely He does not like the transgressors.\n56. Do not spread corruption in the land after it has been set in order. And\ncall upon Him with hope and fear. Indeed, Allah’s mercy is always close to\nthe good-doers.\nParable of Resurrection\n57. He is the One Who sends the winds ushering in His mercy. When they\nbear heavy clouds, We drive them to a lifeless land and then cause rain to\nfall, producing every type of fruit. Similarly, We will bring the dead to life,\nso perhaps you will be mindful.\nParable of Believers and Disbelievers\n58. The fertile land produces abundantly by the Will of its Lord, whereas\nthe infertile land hardly produces anything. This is how We vary ˹Our˺\nlessons to those who are thankful.\nProphet Noah\n59. Indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O my people! Worship\nAllah—you have no other god except Him. I truly fear for you the torment\nof a tremendous Day.”\nHis People’s Response\n60. But the chiefs of his people said, “We surely see that you are clearly\nmisguided.” 61. He replied, “O my people! I am not misguided! But I am a\nmessenger from the Lord of all worlds, 62. conveying to you my Lord’s\nmessages and giving you ˹sincere˺ advice. And I know from Allah what you\ndo not know. 63. Do you find it astonishing that a reminder should come to\nyou from your Lord through one of your own, warning you, so you may\nbeware and perhaps be shown mercy?”\n\n-- 148 of 694 --\n\nThe Fate of His People\n64. But they rejected him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark,\nand drowned those who rejected Our signs. They were certainly a blind\npeople.\nProphet Hûd\n65. And to the people of ’Âd We sent their brother Hûd. He said, “O my\npeople! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. Will you not\nthen fear Him?”\nHis People’s Response\n66. The disbelieving chiefs of his people responded, “We surely see you as\na fool, and we certainly think you are a liar.” 67. Hûd replied, “O my\npeople! I am no fool! But I am a messenger from the Lord of all worlds, 68.\nconveying to you my Lord’s messages. And I am your sincere advisor. 69.\nDo you find it astonishing that a reminder should come to you from your\nLord through one of your own so he may warn you? Remember that He\nmade you successors after the people of Noah and increased you greatly in\nstature. So remember Allah’s favours, so you may be successful.” 70. They\nsaid, “Have you come to us so that we would worship Allah alone and\nabandon what our forefathers used to worship? Then bring us what you\nthreaten us with, if what you say is true!” 71. He said, “You will certainly\nbe subjected to your Lord’s torment and wrath. Do you dispute with me\nregarding the so-called gods which you and your forefathers have made up\n—a practice Allah has never authorized? Then wait! I too am waiting with\nyou.”\nThe Fate of His People\n72. So We saved him and those with him by Our mercy and uprooted those\nwho denied Our signs. They were not believers.\nProphet\nṢâli\nḥ\n73. And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O\nmy people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear\nproof has come to you from your Lord: this is Allah’s she-camel as a sign to\nyou. So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on Allah’s land and do not harm her, or\nelse you will be overcome by a painful punishment. 74. Remember when\nHe made you successors after ’Âd and established you in the land—˹and˺\n\n-- 149 of 694 --\n\nyou built palaces on its plains and carved homes into mountains. So\nremember Allah’s favours, and do not go about spreading corruption in the\nland.”\nHis People’s Response\n75. The arrogant chiefs of his people asked the lowly who believed among\nthem, “Are you certain that Ṣâliḥ has been sent by his Lord?” They replied,\n“We certainly believe in what he has been sent with.” 76. The arrogant said,\n“We surely reject what you believe in.” 77. Then they killed the she-camel\n—defying their Lord’s command—and challenged ˹Ṣâliḥ˺, “Bring us what\nyou threaten us with, if you are ˹truly˺ one of the messengers.”\nThe Fate of His People\n78. Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them, and they fell lifeless in\ntheir homes. 79. So he turned away from them, saying, “O my people!\nSurely I conveyed to you my Lord’s message and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice,\nbut you do not like ˹sincere˺ advisors.”\nProphet Lot\n80. And ˹remember˺ when Lot scolded ˹the men of˺ his people, ˹saying,˺\n“Do you commit a shameful deed that no man has ever done before? 81.\nYou lust after men instead of women! You are certainly transgressors.”\nHis People’s Response\n82. But his people’s only response was to say, “Expel them from your land!\nThey are a people who wish to remain chaste!”\nThe Fate of His People\n83. So We saved him and his family except his wife, who was one of the\ndoomed. 84. We poured upon them a rain ˹of brimstone˺. See what was the\nend of the wicked!\nProphet Shu’aib\n85. And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O\nmy people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear\nproof has already come to you from your Lord. So give just measure and\nweight, do not defraud people of their property, nor spread corruption in the\nland after it has been set in order. This is for your own good, if you are\n˹truly˺ believers. 86. And do not lie in ambush on every road—threatening\nand hindering those who believe in Allah from His Path and striving to\n\n-- 150 of 694 --\n\nmake it ˹appear˺ crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased\nyou in number. And consider the fate of the corruptors! 87. If some of you\ndo believe in what I have been sent with while others do not, then be patient\nuntil Allah judges between us. He is the Best of Judges.”\nHis People’s Response\n88. The arrogant chiefs of his people threatened, “O Shu’aib! We will\ncertainly expel you and your fellow believers from our land, unless you\nreturn to our faith.” He replied, “Even if we hate it? 89. We would surely be\nfabricating a lie against Allah if we were to return to your faith after Allah\nhas saved us from it. It does not befit us to return to it unless it is the Will of\nAllah, our Lord. Our Lord has encompassed everything in ˹His˺ knowledge.\nIn Allah we trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people with truth.\nYou are the best of those who judge.”\nThe Fate of His People\n90. The disbelieving chiefs of his people threatened, “If you follow Shu’aib,\nyou will surely be losers!” 91. Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck\nthem and they fell lifeless in their homes. 92. Those who rejected Shu’aib\nwere ˹wiped out˺ as if they had never lived there. Those who rejected\nShu’aib were the true losers. 93. He turned away from them, saying, “O my\npeople! Indeed, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave\nyou ˹sincere˺ advice. How can I then grieve for those who chose to\ndisbelieve?”\nDestroyed Peoples\n94. Whenever We sent a prophet to a society, We afflicted its ˹disbelieving˺\npeople with suffering and adversity, so perhaps they would be humbled. 95.\nThen We changed their adversity to prosperity until they flourished and\nargued ˹falsely˺, “Our forefathers ˹too˺ had been visited by adversity and\nprosperity.”[319] So We seized them by surprise, while they were unaware.\nLearn from History\n96. Had the people of those societies been faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺,\nWe would have overwhelmed them with blessings from heaven and earth.\nBut they disbelieved, so We seized them for what they used to commit. 97.\nDid the people of those societies feel secure that Our punishment would not\ncome upon them by night while they were asleep? 98. Or did they feel\n\n-- 151 of 694 --\n\nsecure that Our punishment would not come upon them by day while they\nwere at play? 99. Did they feel secure against Allah’s planning? None\nwould feel secure from Allah’s planning except the losers. 100. Is it not\nclear to those who take over the land after ˹the destruction of˺ its former\nresidents that—if We will—We can punish them ˹too˺ for their sins and seal\ntheir hearts so they will not hear ˹the truth˺?\nSealed Hearts\n101. We have narrated to you ˹O Prophet˺ some of the stories of those\nsocieties. Surely, their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but still\nthey would not believe in what they had already denied. This is how Allah\nseals the hearts of the disbelievers. 102. We did not find most of them true\nto their covenant. Rather, We found most of them truly rebellious.\nProphet Moses\n103. Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his\nchiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See what was the end of the\ncorruptors! 104. And Moses said, “O Pharaoh! I am truly a messenger from\nthe Lord of all worlds, 105. obliged to say nothing about Allah except the\ntruth. Indeed, I have come to you with clear proof from your Lord, so let the\nchildren of Israel go with me.” 106. Pharaoh said, “If you have come with a\nsign, then bring it if what you say is true.” 107. So Moses threw down his\nstaff and—behold!—it became a real snake. 108. Then he drew his hand\n˹out of his collar˺ and it was ˹shining˺ white for all to see.\nMoses vs. Pharaoh’s Magicians\n109. The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, “He is indeed a skilled magician,\n110. who seeks to drive you from your land.” ˹So Pharaoh asked,˺ “What do\nyou propose?” 111. They replied, “Let him and his brother wait and send\nmobilizers to all cities 112. to bring you every clever magician.” 113. The\nmagicians came to Pharaoh, saying, “Shall we receive a ˹suitable˺ reward if\nwe prevail?” 114. He replied, “Yes, and you will certainly be among those\nclosest to me.” 115. They asked, “O Moses! Will you cast, or shall we be\nthe first to cast?” 116. Moses said, “You first.” So when they did, they\ndeceived the eyes of the people, stunned them, and made a great display of\nmagic. 117. Then We inspired Moses, “Throw down your staff,” and—\nbehold!—it devoured the objects of their illusion! 118. So the truth\nprevailed and their illusions failed.\n\n-- 152 of 694 --\n\nMagicians Become Believers\n119. So Pharaoh and his people were defeated right there and put to shame.\n120. And the magicians fell down, prostrating. 121. They declared, “We\n˹now˺ believe in the Lord of all worlds— 122. the Lord of Moses and\nAaron.” 123. Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I\ngive you permission? This must be a conspiracy you devised in the city to\ndrive out its people, but soon you will see. 124. I will certainly cut off your\nhands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.” 125. They\nresponded, “Surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return. 126. Your rage towards\nus is only because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to\nus. Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, and let us die while submitting\n˹to You˺.”[320]\nPharaoh’s Persecution of the Israelites\n127. The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people protested, “Are you going to leave\nMoses and his people free to spread corruption in the land and abandon you\nand your gods?” He responded, “We will kill their sons and keep their\nwomen.[321] We will completely dominate them.”\nMoses Reassures His People\n128. Moses reassured his people, “Seek Allah’s help and be patient. Indeed,\nthe earth belongs to Allah ˹alone˺. He grants it to whoever He chooses of\nHis servants. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.” 129.\nThey complained, “We have always been oppressed—before and after you\ncame to us ˹with the message˺.” He replied, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy\nyour enemy and make you successors in the land to see what you will do.”\nEgypt Plagued\n130. Indeed, We afflicted Pharaoh’s people with famine and shortage of\ncrops so they might come back ˹to their senses˺. 131. In times of prosperity,\nthey said, “This is what we deserve,” but in adversity, they blamed it on\nMoses and those with him.[322] Surely all is destined by Allah. Yet most of\nthem did not know.\nPharaoh’s People in Denial\n132. They said, “No matter what sign you may bring to deceive us, we will\nnever believe in you.” 133. So We plagued them with floods, locusts, lice,\nfrogs, and blood—all as clear signs, but they persisted in arrogance and\n\n-- 153 of 694 --\n\nwere a wicked people. 134. When tormented, they pleaded, “O Moses! Pray\nto your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you. If\nyou help remove this torment from us, we will certainly believe in you and\nlet the Children of Israel go with you.” 135. But as soon as We removed the\ntorment from them—until they met their inevitable fate[323]—they broke\ntheir promise. 136. So We inflicted punishment upon them, drowning them\nin the sea for denying Our signs and being heedless of them. 137. And ˹so˺\nWe made the oppressed people successors of the eastern and western lands,\nwhich We had showered with blessings. ˹In this way˺ the noble Word of\nyour Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel for what they had endured.\nAnd We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people constructed and what they\nestablished.\nThe Israelites Demanding an Idol\n138. We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon a\npeople devoted to idols. They demanded, “O Moses! Make for us a god like\ntheir gods.” He replied, “Indeed, you are a people acting ignorantly! 139.\nWhat they follow is certainly doomed to destruction and their deeds are in\nvain.” 140. He added, “Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, while\nHe has honoured you above the others?” 141. And ˹remember˺ when We\nrescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful\ntorment—killing your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test\nfrom your Lord.\nMoses’ Appointment with Allah\n142. We appointed for Moses thirty nights then added another ten—\ncompleting his Lord’s term of forty nights. Moses commanded his brother\nAaron, “Take my place among my people, do what is right, and do not\nfollow the way of the corruptors.” 143. When Moses came at the appointed\ntime and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, “My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me\nso I may see You.” Allah answered, “You cannot see Me! But look at the\nmountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When\nhis Lord appeared to the mountain, He levelled it to dust and Moses\ncollapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I\nturn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.” 144. Allah\nsaid, “O Moses! I have ˹already˺ elevated you above all others by My\n\n-- 154 of 694 --\n\nmessages and speech.[324] So hold firmly to what I have given you and be\ngrateful.”\nThe Tablets\n145. We wrote for him on the Tablets ˹the fundamentals˺ of everything;\ncommandments and explanations of all things. ˹We commanded,˺ “Hold to\nthis firmly and ask your people to take the best of it.[325] I will soon show\n˹all of˺ you the home of the rebellious.[326] 146. I will turn away from My\nsigns those who act unjustly with arrogance in the land. And even if they\nwere to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. If they see the\nRight Path, they will not take it. But if they see a crooked path, they will\nfollow it. This is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.\n147. The deeds of those who deny Our signs and the meeting ˹with Allah˺\nin the Hereafter will be in vain. Will they be rewarded except for what they\nhave done?”\nThe Golden Calf\n148. In the absence of Moses, his people made from their ˹golden˺ jewellery\nan idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could\nneither speak to them nor guide them to the ˹Right˺ Path? Still they took it\nas a god and were wrongdoers. 149. Later, when they were filled with\nremorse and realized they had gone astray, they cried, “If our Lord does not\nhave mercy on us and forgive us, we will certainly be losers.” 150. Upon\nMoses’ return to his people, ˹totally˺ furious and sorrowful, he said, “What\nan evil thing you committed in my absence! Did you want to hasten your\nLord’s torment?” Then he threw down the Tablets and grabbed his brother\nby the hair, dragging him closer. Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! The\npeople overpowered me and were about to kill me. So do not ˹humiliate me\nand˺ make my enemies rejoice, nor count me among the wrongdoing\npeople.”\nMoses Prays for Forgiveness\n151. Moses prayed, “My Lord! Forgive me and my brother! And admit us\ninto Your mercy. You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” 152. Those\nwho worshipped the calf will certainly be afflicted with Allah’s wrath as\nwell as disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We reward those who\ninvent falsehood. 153. But those who commit evil, then repent and become\n\n-- 155 of 694 --\n\n˹true˺ believers, your Lord will certainly be All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.\n154. When Moses’ anger subsided, he took up the Tablets whose text\ncontained guidance and mercy for those who stand in awe of their Lord.\nBegging for Allah’s Mercy\n155. Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment\nand, when they were seized by an earthquake,[327] he cried, “My Lord! Had\nYou willed, You could have destroyed them long ago, and me as well. Will\nYou destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is only a test\nfrom You—by which You allow whoever you will to stray and guide\nwhoever You will. You are our Guardian. So forgive us and have mercy on\nus. You are the best forgiver. 156. Ordain for us what is good in this life and\nthe next. Indeed, we have turned to You ˹in repentance˺.” Allah replied, “I\nwill inflict My torment on whoever I will. But My mercy encompasses\neverything. I will ordain mercy for those who shun evil, pay alms-tax, and\nbelieve in Our revelations.\nProphet Muḥammad in the Bible\n157. “˹They are˺ the ones who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet,\nwhose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel.[328] He\ncommands them to do good and forbids them from evil, permits for them\nwhat is lawful and forbids to them what is impure, and relieves them from\ntheir burdens and the shackles that bound them. ˹Only˺ those who believe in\nhim, honour and support him, and follow the light sent down to him will be\nsuccessful.”\nUniversality of Islam\n158. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! I am Allah’s Messenger to you all. To\nHim ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no\ngod ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He gives life and causes death.” So\nbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in\nAllah and His revelations. And follow him, so you may be ˹rightly˺ guided.\nThe Israelites Tested\n159. There are some among the people of Moses who guide with the truth\nand establish justice accordingly. 160. We divided them into twelve tribes—\neach as a community. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked\nfor water, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out.\n\n-- 156 of 694 --\n\nEach tribe knew its drinking place. We shaded them with clouds and sent\ndown to them manna and quails,[329] ˹saying˺, “Eat from the good things We\nhave provided for you.” They ˹certainly˺ did not wrong Us, but wronged\nthemselves. 161. And ˹remember˺ when it was said to them, “Enter this city\n˹of Jerusalem˺ and eat from wherever you please. Say, ‘Absolve us,’ and\nenter the gate with humility. We will forgive your sins, ˹and˺ We will\nmultiply the reward for the good-doers.” 162. But the wrongdoers among\nthem changed the words they were commanded to say. So We sent down a\npunishment from the heavens upon them for their wrongdoing.\nThe Sabbath-Breakers\n163. Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the\nsea, who broke the Sabbath.[330] During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would\ncome to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In\nthis way We tested them for their rebelliousness. 164. When some of ˹the\nrighteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do\nyou ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed\nor severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your\nLord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.” 165. When they ignored\nthe warning they were given, We rescued those who used to warn against\nevil and overtook the wrongdoers with a dreadful punishment for their\nrebelliousness. 166. But when they stubbornly persisted in violation, We\nsaid to them, “Be disgraced apes!”[331]\nThe Israelites Tested Again\n167. And ˹remember, O Prophet,˺ when your Lord declared that He would\nsend against them others who would make them suffer terribly until the Day\nof Judgment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in punishment, but He is certainly\nAll-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 168. We dispersed them through the land in\ngroups—some were righteous, others were less so. We tested them with\nprosperity and adversity, so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺.\nTheir Successors\n169. Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the\nScripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven\n˹after all˺.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a\ncovenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say\n\n-- 157 of 694 --\n\nanything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed\nin its teachings. But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for\nthose mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand? 170. As for those\nwho firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never\ndiscount the reward of those acting righteously.\nCovenant with the Israelites\n171. And ˹remember˺ when We raised the mountain over them as if it were\na cloud and they thought it would fall on them.[332] ˹We said,˺ “Hold firmly\nto that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and observe its teachings so\nperhaps you will become mindful ˹of Allah˺.”\nCovenant with Humanity\n172. And ˹remember˺ when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the\nchildren of Adam their descendants and had them testify regarding\nthemselves. ˹Allah asked,˺ “Am I not your Lord?” They replied, “Yes, You\nare! We testify.” ˹He cautioned,˺ “Now you have no right to say on\nJudgment Day, ‘We were not aware of this.’ 173. Nor say, ‘It was our\nforefathers who had associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺ and we, as\ntheir descendants, followed in their footsteps. Will you then destroy us for\nthe falsehood they invented?’” 174. This is how We make our signs clear,\nso perhaps they will return ˹to the Right Path˺.\nThe Deviant Scholar[333]\n175. And relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of the one to whom We gave\nOur signs, but he abandoned them, so Satan took hold of him, and he\nbecame a deviant. 176. If We had willed, We would have elevated him with\nOur signs, but he clung to this life—following his evil desires. His example\nis that of a dog: if you chase it away, it pants, and if you leave it, it ˹still˺\npants. This is the example of the people who deny Our signs.[334] So narrate\n˹to them˺ stories ˹of the past˺, so perhaps they will reflect. 177. What an evil\nexample of those who denied Our signs! They ˹only˺ wronged their own\nsouls.\nGuidance from Allah Only\n178. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray,\nthey are the ˹true˺ losers. 179. Indeed, We have destined many jinn and\nhumans for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with, eyes they\n\n-- 158 of 694 --\n\ndo not see with, and ears they do not hear with. They are like cattle. In fact,\nthey are even less guided! Such ˹people˺ are ˹entirely˺ heedless.\nAllah’s Beautiful Names\n180. Allah has the Most Beautiful Names. So call upon Him by them, and\nkeep away from those who abuse His Names.[335] They will be punished for\nwhat they used to do.\nThe Guided and the Misguided\n181. And among those We created is a group that guides with the truth and\nestablishes justice accordingly. 182. As for those who deny Our signs, We\nwill gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot comprehend.\n183. I ˹only˺ delay their end for a while, but My planning is flawless.\nRejecting the Prophet\n184. Have they not ever given it a thought? Their fellow man[336] is not\ninsane. He is only sent with a clear warning. 185. Have they ever reflected\non the wonders of the heavens and the earth, and everything Allah has\ncreated, and that perhaps their end is near? So what message after this\n˹Quran˺ would they believe in? 186. Whoever Allah allows to stray, none\ncan guide, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance.\nTime of the Final Hour\n187. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?” Say,\n“That knowledge is only with my Lord. He alone will reveal it when the\ntime comes. It is too tremendous for the heavens and the earth and will only\ntake you by surprise.” They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say,\n“That knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.” 188.\nSay, “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of\nAllah. If I had known the unknown, I would have benefited myself\nenormously, and no harm would have ever touched me. I am only a warner\nand deliverer of good news for those who believe.”\nGoing Astray\n189. He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made\nits spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her,\nshe carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy,\nthey prayed to Allah, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will\ncertainly be grateful.” 190. But when He granted their descendants good\n\n-- 159 of 694 --\n\noffspring, they associated false gods in what He has given them. Exalted is\nAllah above what they associate ˹with Him˺!\nHelpless Gods\n191. Do they associate ˹with Allah˺ those ˹idols˺ which cannot create\nanything, but are in fact created; 192. which cannot help them, or even help\nthemselves? 193. And if you ˹idolaters˺ call upon them for guidance, they\ncannot respond to you. It is all the same whether you call them or remain\nsilent. 194. Those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah are created beings like\nyourselves. So call upon them and see if they will answer you, if your\nclaims are true! 195. Do they have feet to walk with? Or hands to hold\nwith? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call\nupon your associate-gods and conspire against me without delay!\nAllah Is the Protector\n196. “Indeed, my Protector is Allah Who has revealed this Book. For He\n˹alone˺ protects the righteous. 197. But those ˹false gods˺ you call besides\nHim can neither help you nor even themselves.” 198. If you ˹idolaters˺ call\nthem to guidance, they cannot hear. And you ˹O Prophet˺ may see them\nfacing towards you, but they cannot see.\nGrace and Tolerance\n199. Be gracious, enjoin what is right, and turn away from those who act\nignorantly.\nEvil Impulses\n200. If you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Surely He is\nAll-Hearing, All-Knowing. 201. Indeed, when Satan whispers to those\nmindful ˹of Allah˺, they remember ˹their Lord˺ then they start to see ˹things˺\nclearly. 202. But the devils persistently plunge their ˹human˺ associates[337]\ndeeper into wickedness, sparing no effort.\nOnly a Messenger\n203. If you ˹O Prophet˺ do not bring them a sign ˹which they demanded˺,\nthey ask, “Why do you not make it yourself?” Say, “I only follow what is\nrevealed to me from my Lord. This ˹Quran˺ is an insight from your Lord—a\nguide and a mercy for those who believe.”\nHonouring the Quran\n\n-- 160 of 694 --\n\n204. When the Quran is recited, listen to it attentively and be silent, so you\nmay be shown mercy.\nBeing in Awe of Allah\n205. Remember your Lord inwardly with humility and reverence and in a\nmoderate tone of voice, both morning and evening. And do not be one of\nthe heedless. 206. Surely those ˹angels˺ nearest to your Lord are not too\nproud to worship Him. They glorify Him. And to Him they prostrate.\n***\n\n-- 161 of 694 --\n\n8. Spoils of War\n(Al-Anfâl)\nThis sûrah was revealed in Medina to explain how the spoils of war should\nbe distributed following the believers’ victory over the Meccan pagans at\nBadr in 2 A.H./624 C.E. The sûrah urges the believers to be true to Allah\nand His Messenger, reminding them of how they were outnumbered but\nAllah sent down angels for their aid. It is made clear that although victory\ncomes only from Allah, the believers should always be ready to defend\nthemselves and be open for peace. The pagans are warned that their plots\nto hinder others from Allah’s Way and oppose the truth will only end in\nfailure—a theme emphasized in both the previous and the following sûrahs.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nDistribution of Spoils of War[338]\n1. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the spoils of war. Say, “Their\ndistribution is decided by Allah and His Messenger. So be mindful of Allah,\nsettle your affairs, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are ˹true˺\nbelievers.”\nQualities of True Believers\n2. The ˹true˺ believers are only those whose hearts tremble at the\nremembrance of Allah, whose faith increases when His revelations are\nrecited to them, and who put their trust in their Lord. 3. ˹They are˺ those\nwho establish prayer and donate from what We have provided for them. 4.\nIt is they who are the true believers. They will have elevated ranks,\nforgiveness, and an honourable provision from their Lord.\nOpposition to Fighting\n5. Similarly, when your Lord brought you ˹O Prophet˺ out of your home for\na just cause, a group of believers was totally against it. 6. They disputed\nwith you about the truth after it had been made clear, as if they were being\ndriven to death with their eyes wide open.\nEstablishing the Truth\n\n-- 162 of 694 --\n\n7. ˹Remember, O believers,˺ when Allah promised ˹to give˺ you the upper\nhand over either target, you wished to capture the unarmed party.[339] But it\nwas Allah’s Will to establish the truth by His Words and uproot the\ndisbelievers; 8. to firmly establish the truth and wipe out falsehood—even\nto the dismay of the wicked.\nDivine Reinforcement\n9. ˹Remember˺ when you cried out to your Lord for help, He answered, “I\nwill reinforce you with a thousand angels—followed by many others.”[340]\n10. And Allah made this a sign of victory and reassurance to your hearts.\nVictory comes only from Allah. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.\nSense of Serenity\n11. ˹Remember˺ when He caused drowsiness to overcome you, giving you\nserenity.[341] And He sent down rain from the sky to purify you, free you\nfrom Satan’s whispers, strengthen your hearts, and make ˹your˺ steps firm.\nWarning to Meccan Pagans\n12. ˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when your Lord revealed to the angels, “I am\nwith you. So make the believers stand firm. I will cast horror into the hearts\nof the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.” 13. This\nis because they defied Allah and His Messenger. And whoever defies Allah\nand His Messenger, then ˹know that˺ Allah is surely severe in punishment.\n14. That ˹worldly punishment˺ is yours, so taste it! Then the disbelievers\nwill suffer the torment of the Fire.\nDo Not Flee\n15. O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your\nbacks to them. 16. And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a\nmanoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah,\nand their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!\nVictory from Allah\n17. It was not you ˹believers˺ who killed them, but it was Allah Who did so.\nNor was it you ˹O Prophet˺ who threw ˹a handful of sand at the\ndisbelievers˺,[342] but it was Allah Who did so, rendering the believers a\ngreat favour. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 18. As such, Allah\nfrustrates the evil plans of the disbelievers.\n\n-- 163 of 694 --\n\nReasoning with Pagans\n19. If you ˹Meccans˺ sought judgment, now it has come to you. And if you\ncease, it will be for your own good. But if you persist, We will persist. And\nyour forces—no matter how numerous they might be—will not benefit you\nwhatsoever. For Allah is certainly with the believers.\nHearing and Obeying\n20. O believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from\nhim while you hear ˹his call˺. 21. Do not be like those who say, “We hear,”\nbut in fact they are not listening. 22. Indeed, the worst of all beings in the\nsight of Allah are the ˹wilfully˺ deaf and dumb, who do not understand.[343]\n23. Had Allah known any goodness in them, He would have certainly made\nthem hear. ˹But˺ even if He had made them hear, they would have surely\nturned away heedlessly.\nReminder to the Believers\n24. O believers! Respond to Allah and His Messenger when he calls you to\nthat which gives you life. And know that Allah stands between a person and\ntheir heart, and that to Him you will all be gathered. 25. Beware of a trial\nthat will not only affect the wrongdoers among you. And know that Allah is\nsevere in punishment.\nAllah’s Help\n26. Remember when you had been vastly outnumbered and oppressed in the\nland,[344] constantly in fear of attacks by your enemy, then He sheltered\nyou, strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things so\nperhaps you would be thankful.\nWarning to the Believers\n27. O believers! Do not betray Allah and the Messenger, nor betray your\ntrusts knowingly. 28. And know that your wealth and your children are only\na test and that with Allah is a great reward.\nReward of the Believers\n29. O believers! If you are mindful of Allah, He will grant you a standard\n˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺, absolve you of your sins, and\nforgive you. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.\nPagan Conspiracy\n\n-- 164 of 694 --\n\n30. And ˹remember, O Prophet,˺ when the disbelievers conspired to capture,\nkill, or exile you. They planned, but Allah also planned. And Allah is the\nbest of planners.\nPagan Challenge\n31. Whenever Our revelations are recited to them, they challenge ˹you˺,\n“We have already heard ˹the recitation˺. If we wanted, we could have easily\nproduced something similar. This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but ancient fables!”\nPagan Denial\n32. And ˹remember˺ when they prayed, “O Allah! If this is indeed the truth\nfrom You, then rain down stones upon us from the sky or overcome us with\na painful punishment.” 33. But Allah would never punish them while you\n˹O Prophet˺ were in their midst. Nor would He ever punish them if they\nprayed for forgiveness.\nPunishment Deserved\n34. And why should Allah not punish them while they hinder pilgrims from\nthe Sacred Mosque, claiming to be its rightful guardians? None has the right\nto guardianship except those mindful ˹of Allah˺, but most pagans do not\nknow. 35. Their prayer at the Sacred House was nothing but whistling and\nclapping. So taste the punishment for your disbelief.\nPagans’ Wasted Efforts\n36. Surely the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder others from the Path\nof Allah. They will continue to spend to the point of regret. Then they will\nbe defeated and the disbelievers will be driven into Hell, 37. so Allah may\nseparate the evil from the good. He will pile up the evil ones all together\nand then cast them into Hell. They are the ˹true˺ losers.\nPeace Offer\n38. Tell the disbelievers that if they desist, their past will be forgiven. But if\nthey persist, then they have an example in those destroyed before them. 39.\nFight against them until there is no more persecution—and ˹your˺ devotion\nwill be entirely to Allah. But if they desist, then surely Allah is All-Seeing\nof what they do. 40. And if they do not comply, then know that Allah is\nyour Protector. What an excellent Protector, and what an excellent Helper!\nDistribution of Spoils of War\n\n-- 165 of 694 --\n\n41. Know that whatever spoils you take, one-fifth is for Allah and the\nMessenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers, if\nyou ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and what We revealed to Our servant on that\ndecisive day when the two armies met ˹at Badr˺. And Allah is Most Capable\nof everything. 42. ˹Remember˺ when you were on the near side of the\nvalley, your enemy on the far side, and the caravan was below you. Even if\nthe two armies had made an appointment ˹to meet˺, both would have\ncertainly missed it.[345] Still it transpired so Allah may establish what He\nhad destined—that those who were to perish and those who were to survive\nmight do so after the truth had been made clear to both. Surely Allah is All-\nHearing, All-Knowing.\nVision of Enemy Force\n43. ˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when Allah showed them in your dream as few\nin number. Had He shown them to you as many, you ˹believers˺ would have\ncertainly faltered and disputed in the matter. But Allah spared you ˹from\nthat˺. Surely He knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. 44. Then when\nyour armies met, Allah made them appear as few in your eyes, and made\nyou appear as few in theirs, so Allah may establish what He had destined.\nAnd to Allah ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺.\nWord of Advice\n45. O believers! When you face an enemy, stand firm and remember Allah\noften so you may triumph. 46. Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not\ndispute with one another, or you would be discouraged and weakened.\nPersevere! Surely Allah is with those who persevere. 47. Do not be like\nthose ˹pagans˺ who left their homes arrogantly, only to be seen by people\nand to hinder others from Allah’s Path. And Allah is Fully Aware of what\nthey do.\nSatan Tempts the Meccan Pagans\n48. And ˹remember˺ when Satan made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them,\nand said, “No one can overcome you today. I am surely by your side.” But\nwhen the two forces faced off, he cowered and said, “I have absolutely\nnothing to do with you. I certainly see what you do not see. I truly fear\nAllah, for Allah is severe in punishment.”\nTrust in Allah\n\n-- 166 of 694 --\n\n49. ˹Remember˺ when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts\nsaid, “These ˹believers˺ are deluded by their faith.” But whoever puts their\ntrust in Allah, surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.\nEvil Ending\n50. If only you could see when the angels take the souls of the disbelievers,\nbeating their faces and backs, ˹saying,˺ “Taste the torment of burning! 51.\nThis is ˹the reward˺ for what your hands have done. And Allah is never\nunjust to ˹His˺ creation.”\nFate of the Wicked\n52. Their fate is that of the people of Pharaoh and those before them—they\nall disbelieved in Allah’s signs, so Allah seized them for their sins. Indeed,\nAllah is All-Powerful, severe in punishment. 53. This is because Allah\nwould never discontinue His favour to a people until they discontinue their\nfaith. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 54. That was the case with\nPharaoh’s people and those before them—they all rejected the signs of their\nLord, so We destroyed them for their sins and drowned Pharaoh’s people.\nThey were all wrongdoers.\nThose Who Violate Peace Treaties\n55. Indeed, the worst of all beings in the sight of Allah are those who persist\nin disbelief, never to have faith— 56. ˹namely˺ those with whom you ˹O\nProphet˺ have entered into treaties, but they violate them every time, not\nfearing the consequences. 57. If you ever encounter them in battle, make a\nfearsome example of them, so perhaps those who would follow them may\nbe deterred.\nNo Betrayal in Treaties\n58. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ see signs of betrayal by a people, respond by\nopenly terminating your treaty with them. Surely Allah does not like those\nwho betray.\nMilitary Deterrence\n59. Do not let those disbelievers[346] think they are not within reach. They\nwill have no escape. 60. Prepare against them what you ˹believers˺ can of\n˹military˺ power and cavalry to deter Allah’s enemies and your enemies as\nwell as other enemies unknown to you but known to Allah. Whatever you\n\n-- 167 of 694 --\n\nspend in the cause of Allah will be paid to you in full and you will not be\nwronged.\nAdvice to the Prophet: Opt for Peace\n61. If the enemy is inclined towards peace, make peace with them. And put\nyour trust in Allah. Indeed, He ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 62.\nBut if their intention is only to deceive you, then Allah is certainly\nsufficient for you. He is the One Who has supported you with His help and\nwith the believers. 63. He brought their hearts together. Had you spent all\nthe riches in the earth, you could not have united their hearts. But Allah has\nunited them. Indeed, He is Almighty, All-Wise. 64. O Prophet! Allah is\nsufficient for you and for the believers who follow you.\nReadiness to Fight\n65. O Prophet! Motivate the believers to fight. If there are twenty steadfast\namong you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are one hundred\nof you, they will overcome one thousand of the disbelievers, for they are a\npeople who do not comprehend. 66. Now Allah has lightened your burden,\nfor He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred\nsteadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there be one\nthousand, they will overcome two thousand, by Allah’s Will. And Allah is\nwith the steadfast.\nDecision on Captives\n67. It is not fit for a prophet that he should take captives until he has\nthoroughly subdued the land. You ˹believers˺ settled with the fleeting gains\nof this world,[347] while Allah’s aim ˹for you˺ is the Hereafter. Allah is\nAlmighty, All-Wise. 68. Had it not been for a prior decree from Allah,[348]\nyou would have certainly been disciplined with a tremendous punishment\nfor whatever ˹ransom˺ you have taken. 69. Now enjoy what you have taken,\nfor it is lawful and good. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\nRansomed Captives\n70. O Prophet! Tell the captives in your custody, “If Allah finds goodness in\nyour hearts, He will give you better than what has been taken from you, and\nforgive you. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” 71. But if their\nintention is only to betray you ˹O Prophet˺, they sought to betray Allah\n\n-- 168 of 694 --\n\nbefore. But He gave you power over them. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-\nWise.\nGuardianship Among Believers\n72. Those who believed, emigrated, and strived with their wealth and lives\nin the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave them shelter and help—\nthey are truly guardians of one another. As for those who believed but did\nnot emigrate, you have no obligations to them until they emigrate. But if\nthey seek your help ˹against persecution˺ in faith, it is your obligation to\nhelp them, except against people bound with you in a treaty. Allah is All-\nSeeing of what you do.\nGuardianship Among Disbelievers\n73. As for the disbelievers, they are guardians of one another. And unless\nyou ˹believers˺ act likewise, there will be great oppression and corruption in\nthe land.\nTrue Believers\n74. Those who believed, migrated, and struggled in the cause of Allah, and\nthose who gave ˹them˺ shelter and help, they are the true believers. They\nwill have forgiveness and an honourable provision.\nRelatives Inherit One Another\n75. And those who later believed, migrated, and struggled alongside you,\nthey are also with you. But only blood relatives are now entitled to inherit\nfrom one another, as ordained by Allah. Surely Allah has ˹full˺ knowledge\nof everything.[349]\n***\n\n-- 169 of 694 --\n\n9. Repentance\n(At-Tawbah)\nThis sûrah, which is perceived as a continuation of the previous sûrah,\nbegins by openly terminating the peace treaties constantly violated by the\npagans. The believers are urged to march forth with the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nfor the Battle of Tabûk in the summer of 9 A.H./631 C.E. Hypocrites are\nexposed and their false excuses are refuted. Muslims are reminded of how\nAllah turned the believers’ initial defeat into sweeping victory at the Battle\nof\nḤunain and how Allah saved His Messenger (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) from the pagans\nduring his migration to Medina. Allah’s acceptance of repentance is echoed\nthroughout the sûrah, hence its title.\nDeclaration to the Polytheists[350]\n1. ˹This is˺ a discharge from all obligations, by Allah and His Messenger, to\nthe polytheists you ˹believers˺ have entered into treaties with: 2. “You\n˹polytheists˺ may travel freely through the land for four months, but know\nthat you will have no escape from Allah, and that Allah will disgrace the\ndisbelievers.” 3. A declaration from Allah and His Messenger ˹is made˺ to\nall people on the day of the greater pilgrimage[351] that Allah and His\nMessenger are free of the polytheists. So if you ˹pagans˺ repent, it will be\nbetter for you. But if you turn away, then know that you will have no escape\nfrom Allah. And give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the disbelievers of a painful\npunishment.\nException to the Declaration\n4. As for the polytheists who have honoured every term of their treaty with\nyou and have not supported an enemy against you, honour your treaty with\nthem until the end of its term. Surely Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of\nHim˺.\nAfter the Grace Period\n5. But once the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists ˹who\nviolated their treaties˺ wherever you find them,[352] capture them, besiege\nthem, and lie in wait for them on every way. But if they repent, perform\nprayers, and pay alms-tax, then set them free. Indeed, Allah is All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\n\n-- 170 of 694 --\n\nPagans Seeking Protection\n6. And if anyone from the polytheists asks for your protection ˹O Prophet˺,\ngrant it to them so they may hear the Word of Allah, then escort them to a\nplace of safety, for they are a people who have no knowledge.\nTreacherous Polytheists\n7. How can such polytheists have a treaty with Allah and His Messenger,\nexcept those you have made a treaty with at the Sacred Mosque?[353] So, as\nlong as they are true to you, be true to them. Indeed Allah loves those who\nare mindful ˹of Him˺. 8. How ˹can they have a treaty˺? If they were to have\nthe upper hand over you, they would have no respect for kinship or treaty.\nThey only flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are in denial, and\nmost of them are rebellious.\nArab Pagans\n9. They chose a fleeting gain over Allah’s revelations, hindering ˹others˺\nfrom His Way. Evil indeed is what they have done! 10. They do not honour\nthe bonds of kinship or treaties with the believers. It is they who are the\ntransgressors. 11. But if they repent, perform prayer, and pay alms-tax, then\nthey are your brothers in faith. This is how We make the revelations clear\nfor people of knowledge. 12. But if they break their oaths after making a\npledge and attack your faith, then fight the champions of disbelief—who\nnever honour their oaths—so perhaps they will desist.\nOrder to Fight\n13. Will you not fight those who have broken their oaths, conspired to expel\nthe Messenger ˹from Mecca˺, and attacked you first? Do you fear them?\nAllah is more deserving of your fear, if you are ˹true˺ believers. 14. ˹So˺\nfight them and Allah will punish them at your hands, put them to shame,\nhelp you overcome them, and soothe the hearts of the believers— 15.\nremoving rage from their hearts. And Allah pardons whoever He wills. For\nAllah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nWisdom Behind Fighting\n16. Do you ˹believers˺ think that you will be left without Allah proving who\namong you ˹truly˺ struggles ˹in His cause˺ and never takes trusted allies\nother than Allah, His Messenger, or the believers? And Allah is All-Aware\nof what you do.\n\n-- 171 of 694 --\n\nMaintenance of Mosques\n17. It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while they\nopenly profess disbelief. Their deeds are void, and they will be in the Fire\nforever. 18. The mosques of Allah should only be maintained by those who\nbelieve in Allah and the Last Day, establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and fear\nnone but Allah. It is right to hope that they will be among the ˹truly˺ guided.\nNot Equal\n19. Do you ˹pagans˺ consider providing the pilgrims with water and\nmaintaining the Sacred Mosque as equal to believing in Allah and the Last\nDay and struggling in the cause of Allah? They are not equal in Allah’s\nsight. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.\nReward of the Believers\n20. Those who have believed, emigrated, and strived in the cause of Allah\nwith their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of Allah. It is\nthey who will triumph. 21. Their Lord gives them good news of His mercy,\npleasure, and Gardens with everlasting bliss, 22. to stay there for ever and\never. Surely with Allah is a great reward.\nWarning to the Believers\n23. O believers! Do not take your parents and siblings as trusted allies if\nthey choose disbelief over belief. And whoever of you does so, they are the\n˹true˺ wrongdoers. 24. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If your parents and children and\nsiblings and spouses and extended family and the wealth you have acquired\nand the trade you fear will decline and the homes you cherish—˹if all these˺\nare more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and struggling in\nHis Way, then wait until Allah brings about His Will. Allah does not guide\nthe rebellious people.”\nVictory Is from Allah Alone\n25. Indeed Allah has given you ˹believers˺ victory on many battlefields,\neven at the Battle of Ḥunain[354] when you took pride in your great\nnumbers, but they proved of no advantage to you. The earth, despite its\nvastness, seemed to close in on you, then you turned back in retreat. 26.\nThen Allah sent down His reassurance[355] upon His Messenger and the\nbelievers, and sent down forces[356] you could not see, and punished those\nwho disbelieved. Such was the reward of the disbelievers. 27. Then\n\n-- 172 of 694 --\n\nafterwards Allah will turn in grace to whoever He wills.[357] And Allah is\nAll-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nNo More Idolatry at the Ka’bah\n28. O believers! Indeed, the polytheists are ˹spiritually˺ impure,[358] so they\nshould not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year.[359] If you fear\npoverty, Allah will enrich you out of His bounty, if He wills. Surely, Allah\nis All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nCommand to Fight\n29. Fight those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, nor comply\nwith what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor embrace the\nreligion of truth from among those who were given the Scripture,[360] until\nthey pay the tax,[361] willingly submitting, fully humbled.\nBlind Following\n30. The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” while the Christians say, “The\nMessiah is the son of Allah.” Such are their baseless assertions, only\nparroting the words of earlier disbelievers. May Allah condemn them! How\ncan they be deluded ˹from the truth˺? 31. They have taken their rabbis and\nmonks as well as the Messiah, son of Mary, as lords besides Allah,[362] even\nthough they were commanded to worship none but One God. There is no\ngod ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. Glorified is He above what they\nassociate ˹with Him˺!\nThe True Faith\n32. They wish to extinguish Allah’s light[363] with their mouths, but Allah\nwill only allow His light to be perfected, even to the dismay of the\ndisbelievers. 33. He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with ˹true˺\nguidance and the religion of truth, making it prevail over all others, even to\nthe dismay of the polytheists.\nUnlawful Gains\n34. O believers! Indeed, many rabbis and monks consume people’s wealth\nwrongfully and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah. Give good news of a\npainful torment to those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in\nAllah’s cause. 35. The Day ˹will come˺ when their treasure will be heated\nup in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads, sides, and backs branded with it.\n\n-- 173 of 694 --\n\n˹It will be said to them,˺ “This is the treasure you hoarded for yourselves.\nNow taste what you hoarded!”\nHonouring the Sacred Months\n36. Indeed, the number of months ordained by Allah is twelve—in Allah’s\nRecord[364] since the day He created the heavens and the earth—of which\nfour are sacred. That is the Right Way. So do not wrong one another during\nthese months. And together fight the polytheists as they fight against you\ntogether. And know that Allah is with those mindful ˹of Him˺. 37.\nReallocating the sanctity of ˹these˺ months[365] is an increase in disbelief, by\nwhich the disbelievers are led ˹far˺ astray. They adjust the sanctity one year\nand uphold it in another, only to maintain the number of months sanctified\nby Allah, violating the very months Allah has made sacred. Their evil deeds\nhave been made appealing to them. And Allah does not guide the\ndisbelieving people.\nClinging to This Life\n38. O believers! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to\nmarch forth in the cause of Allah, you cling firmly to ˹your˺ land?[366] Do\nyou prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this\nworldly life is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter. 39. If you do\nnot march forth, He will afflict you with a painful torment and replace you\nwith other people. You are not harming Him in the least. And Allah is Most\nCapable of everything.\nSupporting the Prophet\n40. ˹It does not matter˺ if you ˹believers˺ do not support him, for Allah did\nin fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out ˹of Mecca˺ and he\nwas only one of two. While they both were in the cave, he reassured his\ncompanion,[367] “Do not worry; Allah is certainly with us.” So Allah sent\ndown His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you\n˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while\nthe Word of Allah is supreme. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. 41. ˹O\nbelievers!˺ March forth whether it is easy or difficult for you, and strive\nwith your wealth and your lives in the cause of Allah. That is best for you,\nif only you knew.\nFalse Excuse 1) Inability\n\n-- 174 of 694 --\n\n42. Had the gain been within reach and the journey shorter, they would have\nfollowed you, but the distance seemed too long for them. And they will\nswear by Allah, “Had we been able, we would have certainly joined you.”\nThey are ruining themselves. And Allah knows that they are surely lying.\n43. May Allah pardon you ˹O Prophet˺! Why did you give them permission\n˹to stay behind˺ before those who told the truth were distinguished from\nthose who were lying?\nExemption from Fighting\n44. Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask for exemption\nfrom striving with their wealth and their lives. And Allah has perfect\nknowledge of those who are mindful ˹of Him˺. 45. No one would ask for\nexemption except those who have no faith in Allah or the Last Day, and\nwhose hearts are in doubt, so they are torn by their doubts.\nThe Trouble-Makers\n46. Had they ˹really˺ intended to march forth, they would have made\npreparations for it. But Allah disliked that they should go, so He let them\nlag behind, and it was said ˹to them˺, “Stay with those ˹helpless˺ who\nremain behind.” 47. Had they gone forth with you ˹believers˺, they would\nhave been nothing but trouble for you, and would have scrambled around,\nseeking to spread discord in your midst. And some of you would have\neagerly listened to them. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the\nwrongdoers. 48. They had already sought to spread discord before[368] and\ndevised every ˹possible˺ plot against you ˹O Prophet˺, until the truth came\nand Allah’s Will prevailed—much to their dismay.\nFalse Excuse 2) Temptation\n49. There are some of them who say, “Exempt me and do not expose me to\ntemptation.”[369] They have already fallen into temptation. And Hell will\nsurely engulf the disbelievers.\nThose Who Stayed Behind\n50. If a blessing befalls you ˹O Prophet˺, they grieve, but if a disaster befalls\nyou, they say, “We took our precaution in advance,” and turn away,\nrejoicing. 51. Say, “Nothing will ever befall us except what Allah has\ndestined for us. He is our Protector.” So in Allah let the believers put their\ntrust. 52. Say, “Are you awaiting anything to befall us except one of the two\n\n-- 175 of 694 --\n\nbest things: ˹victory or martyrdom˺? But We are awaiting Allah to afflict\nyou with torment either from Him or at our hands. So keep waiting! We too\nare waiting with you.”\nUnaccepted Contributions\n53. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Whether you˺ donate willingly or unwillingly, it will\nnever be accepted from you, for you have been a rebellious people.” 54.\nAnd what prevented their donations from being accepted is that they have\nlost faith in Allah and His Messenger, they never come to prayer except\nhalf-heartedly, and they never donate except resentfully. 55. So let neither\ntheir wealth nor children impress you ˹O Prophet˺. Allah only intends to\ntorment them through these things in this worldly life, then their souls will\ndepart while they are disbelievers.\nFalse Oaths\n56. They swear by Allah that they are part of you, but they are not. They\nonly say so out of fear. 57. If only they could find a refuge, or a cave, or any\nhiding-place, they would rush headlong towards it.\nDiscontent with Charity\n58. There are some of them who are critical of your distribution of alms ˹O\nProphet˺. If they are given some of it they are pleased, but if not they are\nenraged. 59. If only they had been content with what Allah and His\nMessenger had given them and said, “Allah is sufficient for us! Allah will\ngrant us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger. To Allah ˹alone˺ we\nturn with hope.”\nAlms-Tax Recipients\n60. Alms-tax is only for the poor and the needy, for those employed to\nadminister it, for those whose hearts are attracted ˹to the faith˺, for ˹freeing˺\nslaves, for those in debt, for Allah’s cause, and for ˹needy˺ travellers. ˹This\nis˺ an obligation from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nCriticizing the Prophet\n61. And there are others who hurt the Prophet by saying, “He listens to\nanyone.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He listens to what is best for you. He believes\nin Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a mercy for those who believe\namong you.” Those who hurt Allah’s Messenger will suffer a painful\npunishment.\n\n-- 176 of 694 --\n\nThe Disgrace\n62. They swear by Allah to you ˹believers˺ in order to please you, while it is\nthe pleasure of Allah and His Messenger they should seek, if they are ˹true˺\nbelievers. 63. Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His\nMessenger will be in the Fire of Hell forever? That is the ultimate disgrace.\nBlasphemy Exposed\n64. The hypocrites fear that a sûrah should be revealed about them,\nexposing what is in their hearts. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Keep mocking! Allah\nwill definitely bring to light what you fear.” 65. If you question them, they\nwill certainly say, “We were only talking idly and joking around.” Say,\n“Was it Allah, His revelations, and His Messenger that you ridiculed?” 66.\nMake no excuses! You have lost faith after your belief. If We pardon a\ngroup of you,[370] We will punish others for their wickedness.\nPunishment of the Hypocrites\n67. The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike: they encourage\nwhat is evil, forbid what is good, and withhold ˹what is in˺ their hands.\nThey neglected Allah, so He neglected them. Surely the hypocrites are the\nrebellious. 68. Allah has promised the hypocrites, both men and women,\nand the disbelievers an everlasting stay in the Fire of Hell—it is sufficient\nfor them. Allah has condemned them, and they will suffer a never-ending\npunishment.\nFate of the Disbelievers\n69. ˹You hypocrites are˺ like those ˹disbelievers˺ before you. They were far\nsuperior to you in might and more abundant in wealth and children. They\nenjoyed their share in this life. You have enjoyed your share, just as they\ndid. And you have engaged in idle talk, just as they did. Their deeds have\nbecome void in this world and the Hereafter. And it is they who are the\n˹true˺ losers. 70. Have they not received the stories of those ˹destroyed˺\nbefore them: the people of Noah, ’Âd, and Thamûd, the people of Abraham,\nthe residents of Midian, and the overturned cities ˹of Lot˺?[371] Their\nmessengers came to them with clear proofs. Allah would have never\nwronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.\nReward of the Believers\n\n-- 177 of 694 --\n\n71. The believers, both men and women, are guardians of one another. They\nencourage good and forbid evil, establish prayer and pay alms-tax, and obey\nAllah and His Messenger. It is they who will be shown Allah’s mercy.\nSurely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. 72. Allah has promised the believers,\nboth men and women, Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there\nforever, and splendid homes in the Gardens of Eternity, and—above all—\nthe pleasure of Allah. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.\nReturning Favour with Ingratitude\n73. O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be\nfirm with them. Hell will be their home. What an evil destination! 74. They\nswear by Allah that they never said anything ˹blasphemous˺, while they did\nin fact utter a blasphemy, lost faith after accepting Islam, and plotted what\nthey could not carry out.[372] It is only through resentment that they pay\nAllah and His Messenger back for enriching them out of His bounty! If they\nrepent, it will be better for them. But if they turn away, Allah will torment\nthem with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they\nwill have no one on earth to protect or help them.\nThe Ungrateful\n75. And there are some who had made a vow to Allah: “If He gives us from\nHis bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be of the righteous.” 76. But\nwhen He gave them out of His bounty, they withheld it and turned away\nindifferently. 77. So He caused hypocrisy to plague their hearts until the\nDay they will meet Him, for breaking their promise to Allah and for their\nlies. 78. Do they not know that Allah ˹fully˺ knows their ˹evil˺ thoughts and\nsecret talks, and that Allah is the Knower of all unseen?\nDonations Criticized[373]\n79. ˹There are˺ those who slander ˹some of˺ the believers for donating\nliberally and mock others for giving only the little they can afford. Allah\nwill throw their mockery back at them, and they will suffer a painful\npunishment. 80. ˹It does not matter˺ whether you ˹O Prophet˺ pray for them\nto be forgiven or not. Even if you pray for their forgiveness seventy times,\nAllah will never forgive them. That is because they have lost faith in Allah\nand His Messenger. And Allah does not guide the rebellious people.\nFalse Excuse 3) Heat\n\n-- 178 of 694 --\n\n81. Those ˹hypocrites˺ who remained behind rejoiced for doing so in\ndefiance of the Messenger of Allah and hated ˹the prospect of˺ striving with\ntheir wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah. They said ˹to one another˺,\n“Do not march forth in the heat.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The Fire of Hell is far\nhotter!” If only they could comprehend! 82. So let them laugh a little—they\nwill weep much as a reward for what they have committed.\nInstructions to the Prophet\n83. If Allah returns you ˹O Prophet˺ to a group of them and they ask to go\nforth with you, say, “You will not ever go forth or fight an enemy along\nwith me. You preferred to stay behind the first time, so stay with those\n˹helpless˺ who remain behind.” 84. And do not ever offer ˹funeral˺ prayers\nfor any of their dead, nor stand by their grave ˹at burial˺, for they have lost\nfaith in Allah and His Messenger and died rebellious. 85. And let neither\ntheir wealth nor children impress you ˹O Prophet˺. Allah only intends to\ntorment them through these things in this world, and ˹then˺ their souls will\ndepart while they are disbelievers.\nThe Unfaithful\n86. Whenever a sûrah is revealed stating, “Believe in Allah and struggle\nalong with His Messenger,” the rich among them would ask to be exempt,\nsaying, “Leave us with those who remain behind.” 87. They preferred to\nstay behind with the helpless, and their hearts have been sealed so they do\nnot comprehend.\nThe Faithful\n88. But the Messenger and the believers with him strived with their wealth\nand their lives. They will have all the best, and it is they who will be\nsuccessful. 89. Allah has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers\nflow, to stay there forever. That is the ultimate triumph.\nUnfaithful Nomads\n90. Some nomadic Arabs ˹also˺ came with excuses, seeking exemption.\nAnd those who were untrue to Allah and His Messenger remained behind\n˹with no excuse˺. The unfaithful among them will be afflicted with a painful\npunishment.\nValid Excuses\n\n-- 179 of 694 --\n\n91. There is no blame on the weak, the sick, or those lacking the means ˹if\nthey stay behind˺, as long as they are true to Allah and His Messenger.\nThere is no blame on the good-doers. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful. 92. Nor ˹is there any blame on˺ those who came to you ˹O\nProphet˺ for mounts, then when you said, “I can find no mounts for you,”\nthey left with eyes overflowing with tears out of grief that they had nothing\nto contribute.\nInvalid Excuses\n93. Blame is only on those who seek exemption from you although they\nhave the means. They preferred to stay behind with the helpless, and Allah\nhas sealed their hearts so they do not realize ˹the consequences˺. 94. They\nwill make excuses to you ˹believers˺ when you return to them. Say, “Make\nno excuses, ˹for˺ we will not believe you. Allah has already informed us\nabout your ˹true˺ state ˹of faith˺. Your ˹future˺ deeds will be observed by\nAllah and His Messenger as well. And you will be returned to the Knower\nof the seen and unseen, then He will inform you of what you used to do.”\n95. When you return, they will swear to you by Allah so that you may leave\nthem alone. So leave them alone—they are truly evil. Hell will be their\nhome as a reward for what they have committed. 96. They will swear to you\nin order to please you. And even if you are pleased with them, Allah will\nnever be pleased with the rebellious people.\nUnfaithful Nomads\n97. The nomadic Arabs ˹around Medina˺ are far worse in disbelief and\nhypocrisy, and less likely to know the laws revealed by Allah to His\nMessenger. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. 98. And among the\nnomads are those who consider what they donate to be a loss and await\nyour misfortune. May ill-fortune befall them! And Allah is All-Hearing,\nAll-Knowing.\nFaithful Nomads\n99. However, among the nomadic Arabs are those who believe in Allah and\nthe Last Day, and consider what they donate as a means of coming closer to\nAllah and ˹receiving˺ the prayers of the Messenger. It will certainly bring\nthem closer. Allah will admit them into His mercy. Surely Allah is All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\n\n-- 180 of 694 --\n\nThe Foremost\n100. As for the foremost—the first of the Emigrants[374] and the\nHelpers[375]—and those who follow them in goodness, Allah is pleased\nwith them and they are pleased with Him. And He has prepared for them\nGardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. That is the\nultimate triumph.\nMaster Hypocrites\n101. Some of the nomads around you ˹believers˺ are hypocrites, as are some\nof the people of Medina. They have mastered hypocrisy. They are not\nknown to you ˹O Prophet˺; they are known to Us. We will punish them\ntwice ˹in this world˺,[376] then they will be brought back ˹to their Lord˺ for a\ntremendous punishment.\nThose Who Are Forgiven\n102. Some others have confessed their wrongdoing: they have mixed\ngoodness with evil.[377] It is right to hope that Allah will turn to them in\nmercy. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 103. Take from their\nwealth ˹O Prophet˺ charity to purify and bless them, and pray for them—\nsurely your prayer is a source of comfort for them. And Allah is All-\nHearing, All-Knowing. 104. Do they not know that Allah alone accepts the\nrepentance of His servants and receives ˹their˺ charity, and that Allah alone\nis the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful?\nA Second Chance\n105. Tell ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Do as you will. Your deeds will be observed\nby Allah, His Messenger, and the believers. And you will be returned to the\nKnower of the seen and unseen, then He will inform you of what you used\nto do.”\nThe Three Who Remained Behind[378]\n106. And some others are left for Allah’s decision, either to punish them or\nturn to them in mercy. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nThe Mosque of Harm\n107. There are also those ˹hypocrites˺ who set up a mosque ˹only˺ to cause\nharm, promote disbelief, divide the believers, and as a base for those who\nhad previously fought against Allah and His Messenger.[ 3 7 9 ] They will\ndefinitely swear, “We intended nothing but good,” but Allah bears witness\n\n-- 181 of 694 --\n\nthat they are surely liars. 108. Do not ˹O Prophet˺ ever pray in it. Certainly,\na mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy of\nyour prayers. In it are men who love to be purified.[380] And Allah loves\nthose who purify themselves. 109. Which is better: those who laid the\nfoundation of their building on the fear and pleasure of Allah, or those who\ndid so on the edge of a crumbling cliff that tumbled down with them into\nthe Fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. 110.\nThe building which they erected will never cease to fuel hypocrisy in their\nhearts until their hearts are torn apart. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nThe Finest Bargain\n111. Allah has indeed purchased from the believers their lives and wealth in\nexchange for Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah and kill or are\nkilled. This is a true promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and\nthe Quran. And whose promise is truer than Allah’s? So rejoice in the\nexchange you have made with Him. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.\n112. ˹It is the believers˺ who repent, who are devoted to worship, who\npraise ˹their Lord˺, who fast, who bow down and prostrate themselves, who\nencourage good and forbid evil, and who observe the limits set by Allah.\nAnd give good news to the believers.\nPraying for the Polytheists\n113. It is not ˹proper˺ for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness\nfor the polytheists, even if they were close relatives, after it has become\nclear to the believers that they are bound for the Hellfire. 114. As for\nAbraham’s prayer for his father’s forgiveness, it was only in fulfilment of a\npromise he had made to him. But when it became clear to Abraham that his\nfather was an enemy of Allah, he broke ties with him.[381] Abraham was\ntruly tender-hearted, forbearing. 115. Allah would never consider a people\ndeviant after He has guided them, until He makes clear to them what they\nmust avoid. Surely Allah has ˹full˺ knowledge of everything.\nAllah’s Might\n116. Indeed, to Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the\nearth. He gives life and causes death. And besides Allah you have no\nguardian or helper.\nAllah’s Mercy\n\n-- 182 of 694 --\n\n117. Allah has certainly turned in mercy to the Prophet[382] as well as the\nEmigrants and the Helpers who stood by him in the time of hardship, after\nthe hearts of a group of them had almost faltered. He then accepted their\nrepentance. Surely He is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to them.\nThe Three[383]\n118. And ˹Allah has also turned in mercy to˺ the three who had remained\nbehind, ˹whose guilt distressed them˺ until the earth, despite its vastness,\nseemed to close in on them, and their souls were torn in anguish. They\nknew there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to\nthem in mercy so that they might repent. Surely Allah ˹alone˺ is the\nAccepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. 119. O believers! Be mindful of\nAllah and be with the truthful.\nA Fine Reward\n120. It was not ˹proper˺ for the people of Medina and the nomadic Arabs\naround them to avoid marching with the Messenger of Allah or to prefer\ntheir own lives above his. That is because whenever they suffer from thirst,\nfatigue, or hunger in the cause of Allah; or tread on a territory, unnerving\nthe disbelievers; or inflict any loss on an enemy—it is written to their credit\nas a good deed. Surely Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers.\n121. And whenever they make a donation, small or large, or cross a valley\n˹in Allah’s cause˺—it is written to their credit, so that Allah may grant them\nthe best reward for what they used to do.\nGaining Knowledge\n122. ˹However,˺ it is not necessary for the believers to march forth all at\nonce. Only a party from each group should march forth, leaving the rest to\ngain religious knowledge then enlighten their people when they return to\nthem, so that they ˹too˺ may beware ˹of evil˺.\nFirmness with the Disbelievers[384]\n123. O believers! Fight the disbelievers around you and let them find\nfirmness in you. And know that Allah is with those mindful ˹of Him˺.\nHypocrites Reacting to Revelation\n124. Whenever a sûrah is revealed, some of them ask ˹mockingly˺, “Which\nof you has this increased in faith?” As for the believers, it has increased\nthem in faith and they rejoice. 125. But as for those with sickness in their\n\n-- 183 of 694 --\n\nhearts,[385] it has increased them only in wickedness upon their wickedness,\nand they die as disbelievers. 126. Do they not see that they are tried once or\ntwice every year?[386] Yet they neither repent nor do they learn a lesson.\n127. Whenever a sûrah is revealed, they look at one another, ˹saying,˺ “Is\nanyone watching you?” Then they slip away. ˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ has turned\ntheir hearts away because they are a people who do not comprehend.\nInvitation to All\n128. There certainly has come to you a messenger from among yourselves.\nHe is concerned by your suffering, anxious for your well-being, and\ngracious and merciful to the believers. 129. But if they turn away, then say,\n˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah is sufficient for me. There is no god ˹worthy of\nworship˺ except Him. In Him I put my trust. And He is the Lord of the\nMighty Throne.”\n***\n\n-- 184 of 694 --\n\n10. Jonah\n(Yûnus)\nSimilar to the previous sûrah, this Meccan sûrah emphasizes Allah’s\nacceptance of repentance, most notably in the case of the people of Jonah\n(verse 98). The pagan claims against the Quran are refuted both in this\nsûrah and the next. The short span of this worldly life and people’s\ningratitude to their Creator are elaborated upon. The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is\nurged to exercise patience in the face of denial. The stories of Noah’s people\nand Pharaoh’s people are cited as cautionary tales to the Meccan deniers,\nsetting the stage for more elaborate warnings in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nUniversal Messenger\n1. Alif-Lãm-Ra. These are the verses of the Book, rich in wisdom. 2. Is it\nastonishing to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among\nthemselves, ˹instructing him,˺ “Warn humanity and give good news to the\nbelievers that they will have an honourable status with their Lord.”? Yet the\ndisbelievers said, “Indeed, this ˹man˺ is clearly a magician!”\nOrigin of Creation\n3. Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six\nDays,[387] then established Himself on the Throne, conducting every affair.\nNone can intercede except by His permission. That is Allah—your Lord, so\nworship Him ˹alone˺. Will you not then be mindful? 4. To Him is your\nreturn all together. Allah’s promise is ˹always˺ true. Indeed, He originates\nthe creation then resurrects it so that He may justly reward those who\nbelieve and do good. But those who disbelieve will have a boiling drink and\na painful punishment for their disbelief.\nSigns in Allah’s Creation\n5. He is the One Who made the sun a radiant source and the moon a\nreflected light, with precisely ordained phases, so that you may know the\nnumber of years and calculation ˹of time˺. Allah did not create all this\nexcept for a purpose. He makes the signs clear for people of knowledge. 6.\n\n-- 185 of 694 --\n\nSurely in the alternation of the day and the night, and in all that Allah has\ncreated in the heavens and the earth, there are truly signs for those mindful\n˹of Him˺.\nDeniers of Resurrection\n7. Indeed, those who do not expect to meet Us, being pleased and content\nwith this worldly life, and who are heedless of Our signs, 8. they will have\nthe Fire as a home because of what they have committed.\nGuided by Faith\n9. Surely those who believe and do good, their Lord will guide them ˹to\nParadise˺ through their faith, rivers will flow under their feet in the Gardens\nof Bliss, 10. in which their prayer will be, “Glory be to You, O Allah!” and\ntheir greeting will be, “Peace!” and their closing prayer will be, “All praise\nis for Allah—Lord of all worlds!”\nNo Rush for Evil\n11. If Allah were to hasten evil for people[388] as they wish to hasten good,\nthey would have certainly been doomed. But We leave those who do not\nexpect to meet Us to wander blindly in their defiance.\nThe Ungrateful\n12. Whenever someone is touched by hardship, they cry out to Us, whether\nlying on their side, sitting, or standing. But when We relieve their hardship,\nthey return to their old ways as if they had never cried to Us to remove any\nhardship! This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors have been made\nappealing to them.\nWarning to the Meccan Pagans\n13. We surely destroyed ˹other˺ peoples before you when they did wrong,\nand their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they would not\nbelieve! This is how We reward the wicked people. 14. Then We made you\ntheir successors in the land to see how you would act.\nThe Pagans Demand a New Quran\n15. When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect\nto meet Us say ˹to the Prophet˺, “Bring us a different Quran or make some\nchanges in it.” Say ˹to them˺, “It is not for me to change it on my own. I\nonly follow what is revealed to me. I fear, if I were to disobey my Lord, the\npunishment of a tremendous Day.” 16. Say, “Had Allah willed, I would not\n\n-- 186 of 694 --\n\nhave recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I had lived\nmy whole life among you before this ˹revelation˺. Do you not understand?”\n17. Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah or\ndeny His revelations? Indeed, the wicked will never succeed.\nFalse Gods\n18. They worship besides Allah others who can neither harm nor benefit\nthem, and say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” Ask ˹them, O\nProphet˺, “Are you informing Allah of something He does not know in the\nheavens or the earth? Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate\n˹with Him˺!”\nNo Longer United by Faith\n19. Humanity was once nothing but a single community ˹of believers˺, but\nthen they differed.[389] Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord,\n[390] their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺.\nDemanding a New Miracle[391]\n20. They ask, “Why has no ˹other˺ sign been sent down to him from his\nLord?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹The knowledge of˺ the unseen is with Allah\nalone. So wait! I too am waiting with you.”\nReturning Favour with Denial\n21. When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with a\nhardship, they swiftly devise plots against Our revelations! Say, ˹O\nProphet,˺ “Allah is swifter in devising ˹punishment˺. Surely Our messenger-\nangels record whatever you devise.”\nMetaphor for Human Ingratitude\n22. He is the One Who enables you to travel through land and sea. And it so\nhappens that you are on ships, sailing with a favourable wind, to the\npassengers’ delight. Suddenly, the ships are overcome by a gale wind and\nthose on board are overwhelmed by waves from every side, and they\nassume they are doomed. They cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion,\n“If You save us from this, we will certainly be grateful.” 23. But as soon as\nHe rescues them, they transgress in the land unjustly. O humanity! Your\ntransgression is only against your own souls. ˹There is only˺ brief\nenjoyment in this worldly life, then to Us is your return, and then We will\ninform you of what you used to do.\n\n-- 187 of 694 --\n\nThis Fleeting Life\n24. The life of this world is just like rain We send down from the sky,\nproducing a mixture of plants which humans and animals consume. Then\njust as the earth looks its best, perfectly beautified, and its people think they\nhave full control over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day,\nso We mow it down as if it never flourished yesterday! This is how We\nmake the signs clear for people who reflect.\nInvitation to Paradise\n25. And Allah invites ˹all˺ to the Home of Peace and guides whoever He\nwills to the Straight Path. 26. Those who do good will have the finest\nreward[392] and ˹even˺ more.[393] Neither gloom nor disgrace will cover\ntheir faces. It is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be\nthere forever.\nWarning Against Hell\n27. As for those who commit evil, the reward of an evil deed is its\nequivalent. Humiliation will cover them—with no one to protect them from\nAllah—as if their faces were covered with patches of the night’s deep\ndarkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there\nforever.\nFalse Gods and Their Followers\n28. ˹Consider˺ the Day We will gather them all together then say to those\nwho associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺, “Stay in your places—you\nand your associate-gods.” We will separate them from each other, and their\nassociate-gods will say, “It was not us that you worshipped! 29. Allah is\nsufficient as a Witness between each of us that we were totally unaware of\nyour worship.” 30. Then and there every soul will face ˹the consequences\nof˺ what it had done. They all will be returned to Allah—their True Master.\nAnd whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them.\nQuestions to Pagans: 1) Who Provides?\n31. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from heaven and earth?\nWho owns ˹your˺ hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living from the\ndead and the dead from the living? And who conducts every affair?” They\nwill ˹surely˺ say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not then fear ˹Him˺? 32. That is\nAllah—your True Lord. So what is beyond the truth except falsehood? How\n\n-- 188 of 694 --\n\ncan you then be turned away?” 33. And so your Lord’s decree has been\nproven true against the rebellious—that they will never believe.\n2) Who Creates?\n34. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Can any of your associate-gods originate\ncreation and then resurrect it?” Say, “˹Only˺ Allah originates creation and\nthen resurrects it. How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺?”\n3) Who Guides?\n35. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Can any of your associate-gods guide to the\ntruth?” Say, “˹Only˺ Allah guides to the truth.” Who then is more worthy to\nbe followed: the One Who guides to the truth or those who cannot find the\nway unless guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge? 36.\nMost of them follow nothing but ˹inherited˺ assumptions. ˹And˺ surely\nassumptions can in no way replace the truth. Allah is indeed All-Knowing\nof what they do.\nThe Challenge of the Quran\n37. It is not ˹possible˺ for this Quran to have been produced by anyone other\nthan Allah. In fact, it is a confirmation of what came before, and an\nexplanation of the Scripture. It is, without a doubt, from the Lord of all\nworlds. 38. Or do they claim, “He[394] made it up!”? Tell them ˹O Prophet˺,\n“Produce one sûrah like it then, and seek help from whoever you can—\nother than Allah—if what you say is true!” 39. In fact, they ˹hastily˺\nrejected the Book without comprehending it and before the fulfilment of its\nwarnings. Similarly, those before them were in denial. See then what was\nthe end of the wrongdoers!\nIt Is Allah Who Guides\n40. Some of them will ˹eventually˺ believe in it; others will not. And your\nLord knows best the corruptors. 41. If they deny you, then say, “My deeds\nare mine and your deeds are yours. You are free of what I do and I am free\nof what you do!” 42. Some of them listen to what you say, but can you\nmake the deaf hear even though they do not understand? 43. And some of\nthem look at you, but can you guide the blind even though they cannot see?\n[395] 44. Indeed, Allah does not wrong people in the least, but it is people\nwho wrong themselves.\nShort Life\n\n-- 189 of 694 --\n\n45. On the Day He will gather them, it will be as if they had not stayed ˹in\nthe world˺ except for an hour of a day,[396] ˹as though they were only˺\ngetting to know one another. Lost indeed will be those who denied the\nmeeting with Allah, and were not ˹rightly˺ guided!\nWarning Before Judgment\n46. Whether We show you ˹O Prophet˺ some of what We threaten them\nwith, or cause you to die ˹before that˺, to Us is their return and Allah is a\nWitness over what they do. 47. And for every community there is a\nmessenger. After their messenger has come,[397] judgment is passed on\nthem in all fairness, and they are not wronged.\nWhen the Time Comes …\n48. They ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass if what\nyou say is true?” 49. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have no power to benefit or\nprotect myself, except by the Will of Allah.” For each community there is\nan appointed term. When their time arrives, they cannot delay it for a\nmoment, nor could they advance it.\nAllah’s Torment\n50. Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Imagine if His torment were to overcome you\nby night or day—do the wicked realize what they are ˹really˺ asking Him to\nhasten? 51. Will you believe in it only after it has overtaken you? Now? But\nyou always wanted to hasten it!” 52. Then the wrongdoers will be told,\n“Taste the torment of eternity! Are you not rewarded except for what you\nused to commit?”\nAllah’s Promise\n53. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺, “Is this true?” Say, “Yes, by my Lord! Most\ncertainly it is true! And you will have no escape.” 54. If every wrongdoer\nwere to possess everything in the world, they would surely ransom\nthemselves with it. They will hide ˹their˺ remorse when they see the\ntorment. And they will be judged in all fairness, and none will be wronged.\n55. Surely to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Surely\nAllah’s promise is ˹always˺ true, but most of them do not know. 56. He ˹is\nthe One Who˺ gives life and causes death, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be\nreturned.\nExcellence of the Quran\n\n-- 190 of 694 --\n\n57. O humanity! Indeed, there has come to you a warning from your Lord, a\ncure for what is in the hearts, a guide, and a mercy for the believers. 58.\nSay, ˹O Prophet,˺ “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them rejoice. That is far\nbetter than whatever ˹wealth˺ they amass.”\nAllah’s Provisions\n59. Ask ˹the pagans, O Prophet˺, “Have you seen that which Allah has sent\ndown for you as a provision, of which you have made some lawful and\nsome unlawful?”[398] Say, “Has Allah given you authorization, or are you\nfabricating lies against Allah?” 60. What do those who fabricate lies against\nAllah expect on Judgment Day? Surely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity,\n[399] but most of them are ungrateful.\nAllah’s Knowledge\n61. There is no activity you may be engaged in ˹O Prophet˺ or portion of the\nQuran you may be reciting, nor any deed you ˹all˺ may be doing except that\nWe are a Witness over you while doing it. Not ˹even˺ an atom’s weight is\nhidden from your Lord on earth or in heaven; nor anything smaller or larger\nthan that, but is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record.[400]\nAllah’s Close Servants\n62. There will certainly be no fear for the close servants of Allah, nor will\nthey grieve. 63. ˹They are˺ those who are faithful and are mindful ˹of Him˺.\n64. For them is good news in this worldly life and the Hereafter. There is no\nchange in the promise of Allah. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.\nThe Almighty\n65. Do not let their words grieve you ˹O Prophet˺. Surely all honour and\npower belongs to Allah. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 66. Certainly\nto Allah ˹alone˺ belong all those in the heavens and all those on the earth.\nAnd what do those who associate others with Allah really follow? They\nfollow nothing but assumptions and do nothing but lie. 67. He is the One\nWho has made the night for you to rest in and the day bright. Surely in this\nare signs for people who listen.\nAllah Has No Children\n68. They[401] say, “Allah has offspring.”[402] Glory be to Him! He is the\nSelf-Sufficient. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is\non the earth. You have no proof of this! Do you say about Allah what you\n\n-- 191 of 694 --\n\ndo not know? 69. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, those who fabricate lies against\nAllah will never succeed.” 70. ˹It is only˺ a brief enjoyment in this world,\nthen to Us is their return, then We will make them taste the severe\npunishment for their disbelief.\nNoah and His People\n71. Relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of Noah when he said to his\npeople, “O my People! If my presence and my reminders to you of Allah’s\nsigns are unbearable to you, then ˹know that˺ I have put my trust in Allah.\nSo devise a plot along with your associate-gods—and you do not have to be\nsecretive about your plot—then carry it out against me without delay! 72.\nAnd if you turn away, ˹remember˺ I have never demanded a reward from\nyou ˹for delivering the message˺. My reward is only from Allah. And I have\nbeen commanded to be one of those who submit ˹to Allah˺.” 73. But they\nstill rejected him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark and made\nthem successors, and drowned those who rejected Our signs. See then what\nwas the end of those who had been warned!\nMessengers After Noah\n74. Then after him We sent ˹other˺ messengers to their ˹own˺ people and\nthey came to them with clear proofs. But they would not believe in what\nthey had rejected before. This is how We seal the hearts of the\ntransgressors.\nMoses and Aaron\n75. Then after these ˹messengers˺ We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and\nhis chiefs with Our signs. But they behaved arrogantly and were a wicked\npeople. 76. When the truth came to them from Us, they said, “This is\ncertainly pure magic!” 77. Moses responded, “Is this what you say about\nthe truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? Magicians will never\nsucceed.” 78. They argued, “Have you come to turn us away from the faith\nof our forefathers so that the two of you may become supreme in the land?\nWe will never believe in you!” 79. Pharaoh demanded, “Bring me every\nskilled magician.” 80. When the magicians came, Moses said to them, “Cast\nwhatever you wish to cast!” 81. When they did, Moses said, “What you\nhave produced is mere magic, Allah will surely make it useless, for Allah\ncertainly does not set right the work of the corruptors. 82. And Allah\nestablishes the truth by His Words—even to the dismay of the wicked.”\n\n-- 192 of 694 --\n\nA Few Believers\n83. But no one believed in Moses except a few youths of his people, while\nfearing that Pharaoh and their own chiefs might persecute them. And\ncertainly Pharaoh was a tyrant in the land, and he was truly a transgressor.\n84. Moses said, “O my people! If you do believe in Allah and submit ˹to\nHis Will˺, then put your trust in Him.” 85. They replied, “In Allah we trust.\nOur Lord! Do not subject us to the persecution of the oppressive people, 86.\nand deliver us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people.”\nPower of Prayer\n87. We revealed to Moses and his brother, “Appoint houses for your people\nin Egypt. Turn these houses into places of worship, establish prayer, and\ngive good news to the believers!” 88. Moses prayed, “Our Lord! You have\ngranted Pharaoh and his chiefs luxuries and riches in this worldly life,\n˹which they abused˺ to lead people astray from Your Way! Our Lord,\ndestroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until\nthey see the painful punishment.” 89. Allah responded ˹to Moses and\nAaron˺,[403] “Your prayer is answered! So be steadfast and do not follow the\nway of those who do not know.”\nEnd of Pharaoh\n90. We brought the Children of Israel across the sea. Then Pharaoh and his\nsoldiers pursued them unjustly and oppressively. But as Pharaoh was\ndrowning, he cried out, “I believe that there is no god except that in whom\nthe Children of Israel believe, and I am ˹now˺ one of those who submit.” 91.\n˹He was told,˺ “Now ˹you believe˺? But you always disobeyed and were one\nof the corruptors. 92. Today We will preserve your corpse so that you may\nbecome an example[404] for those who come after you. And surely most\npeople are heedless of Our examples!”\nAllah’s Grace to the Israelites\n93. Indeed, We settled the Children of Israel in a blessed land,[405] and\ngranted them good, lawful provisions. They did not differ until knowledge\ncame to them.[406] Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of\nJudgment regarding their differences.\nConfirming the Truth\n\n-- 193 of 694 --\n\n94. If you ˹O Prophet˺ are in doubt about ˹these stories˺ that We have\nrevealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth\nhas certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who\ndoubt, 95. and do not be one of those who deny Allah’s signs or you will be\none of the losers.[407]\nJonah’s People Spared from Torment\n96. Indeed, those against whom Allah’s decree ˹of torment˺ is justified will\nnot believe— 97. even if every sign were to come to them—until they see\nthe painful punishment. 98. If only there had been a society which believed\n˹before seeing the torment˺ and, therefore, benefited from its belief, like the\npeople of Jonah.[408] When they believed, We lifted from them the torment\nof disgrace in this world and allowed them enjoyment for a while.[409]\nConviction, Not Compulsion\n99. Had your Lord so willed ˹O Prophet˺, all ˹people˺ on earth would have\ncertainly believed, every single one of them! Would you then force people\nto become believers? 100. It is not for any soul to believe except by Allah’s\nleave, and He will bring His wrath upon those who are unmindful.\nInvitation to Think\n101. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Consider all that is in the heavens and the earth!”\nYet neither signs nor warners are of any benefit to those who refuse to\nbelieve. 102. Are they waiting for ˹anything˺ except the same torments that\nbefell those before them? Say, “Keep waiting then! I too am waiting with\nyou.” 103. Then We saved Our messengers and those who believed. For it is\nOur duty to save the believers.\nTrue Faith\n104. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! If you are in doubt of my faith, then\n˹know that˺ I do not worship those ˹idols˺ you worship instead of Allah. But\nI worship Allah, Who has the power to cause your death. And I have been\ncommanded, ‘Be one of the believers,’ 105. and, ‘Be steadfast in faith in all\nuprightness, and do not be one of the polytheists,’ 106. and ‘Do not invoke,\ninstead of Allah, what can neither benefit nor harm you—for if you do, then\nyou will certainly be one of the wrongdoers,’ 107. and ‘If Allah touches you\nwith harm, none can undo it except Him. And if He intends good for you,\n\n-- 194 of 694 --\n\nnone can withhold His bounty. He grants it to whoever He wills of His\nservants. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’”\nCall to Humanity\n108. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! The truth has surely come to you from\nyour Lord. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good.\nAnd whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. And I am not a\nkeeper over you.”\nAdvice to the Prophet\n109. And follow what is revealed to you, and be patient until Allah passes\nHis judgment. For He is the Best of Judges.\n***\n\n-- 195 of 694 --\n\n11. Hûd\n(Hûd)\nThis Meccan sûrah is named after Prophet Hûd (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), whose story is\nmentioned in verses 50-60. More details are given about Noah (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in\nthis sûrah than the previous sûrah and Sûrah 7. Just like the previous sûrah,\nthe stories of destroyed disbelievers are meant to deter the Arab pagans and\nreassure the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) of his ultimate triumph, and a reference is\nmade to the reward of the believers and the punishment of the disbelievers\nin the Hereafter.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nMessage of the Quran\n1. Alif-Lãm-Ra. ˹This is˺ a Book whose verses are well perfected and then\nfully explained. ˹It is˺ from the One ˹Who is˺ All-Wise, All-Aware. 2. ˹Tell\nthem, O Prophet,˺ “Worship none but Allah. Surely I am a warner and\ndeliverer of good news to you from Him. 3. And seek your Lord’s\nforgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. He will grant you a good\nprovision for an appointed term and graciously reward the doers of good.\nBut if you turn away, then I truly fear for you the torment of a formidable\nDay. 4. To Allah is your return. And He is Most Capable of everything.”\nHiding Disbelief\n5. Indeed, they[410] enfold ˹what is in˺ their hearts, ˹trying˺ to hide it from\nHim! But even when they cover themselves with their clothes, He knows\nwhat they conceal and what they reveal. Surely He knows best what is\n˹hidden˺ in the heart.\nAllah’s Might\n6. There is no moving creature on earth whose provision is not guaranteed\nby Allah. And He knows where it lives and where it is laid to rest. All is\n˹written˺ in a perfect Record.[411] 7. He is the One Who created the heavens\nand the earth in six Days[412]—and His Throne was upon the waters—in\norder to test which of you is best in deeds. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ say,\n“Surely you will ˹all˺ be raised up after death,” the disbelievers will\n\n-- 196 of 694 --\n\ncertainly say, “That is nothing but pure magic!” 8. And if We delay their\npunishment until an appointed time, they will definitely say, “What is\nholding it back?” Indeed, on the Day it overtakes them, it will not be\naverted from them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to\nridicule.\nAdversity and Prosperity\n9. If We give people a taste of Our mercy then take it away from them, they\nbecome utterly desperate, ungrateful. 10. But if We give them a taste of\nprosperity after being touched with adversity, they say, “My ills are gone,”\nand become totally prideful and boastful, 11. except those who patiently\nendure and do good. It is they who will have forgiveness and a mighty\nreward.\nPagan Annoyances\n12. Perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ may wish to give up some of what is revealed\nto you and may be distressed by it because they say, “If only a treasure had\nbeen sent down to him, or an angel had come with him!” You are only a\nwarner, and Allah is the Trustee of All Affairs.\nChallenging the Pagans\n13. Or do they say, “He[413] has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Produce ten fabricated sûrahs like it and seek help from whoever you can\n—other than Allah—if what you say is true!” 14. But if your helpers fail\nyou, then know that it has been revealed with the knowledge of Allah, and\nthat there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him! Will you ˹not˺ then\nsubmit ˹to Allah\n˺?\nFleeting Gain\n15. Whoever desires ˹only˺ this worldly life and its luxuries, We will pay\nthem in full for their deeds in this life—nothing will be left out. 16. It is\nthey who will have nothing in the Hereafter except the Fire. Their efforts in\nthis life will be fruitless and their deeds will be useless.\nEverlasting Gain\n17. ˹Can these people be compared to˺ those ˹believers˺ who stand on clear\nproof from their Lord, backed by ˹the Quran as˺ a witness from Him, and\npreceded by the Book of Moses ˹which was revealed˺ as a guide and mercy?\nIt is those ˹believers˺ who have faith in it. But whoever from the\n\n-- 197 of 694 --\n\n˹disbelieving˺ groups rejects it, the Fire will be their destiny. So do not be in\ndoubt of it. It is certainly the truth from your Lord, but most people do not\nbelieve.\nThe Losers\n18. Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah?\nThey will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses[414] will say,\n“These are the ones who lied against their Lord.” Surely Allah’s\ncondemnation is upon the wrongdoers, 19. who hinder ˹others˺ from Allah’s\nPath, striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, and disbelieve in the Hereafter.\n20. They will never frustrate Allah on earth, and they will have no protector\nbesides Allah. Their punishment will be multiplied, for they failed to hear\nor see ˹the truth˺. 21. It is they who have ruined themselves, and whatever\n˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them. 22. Without a doubt, they will be the\nworst losers in the Hereafter.\nThe Winners\n23. Surely those who believe, do good, and humble themselves before their\nLord will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever.\nThe Disbelievers and the Believers\n24. The example of these two parties is that of the blind and the deaf,\ncompared to the seeing and the hearing. Can the two be equal? Will you not\nthen be mindful?\nProphet Noah\n25. Surely We sent Noah to his people. ˹He said,˺ “Indeed, I am sent to you\nwith a clear warning 26. that you should worship none but Allah. I truly\nfear for you the torment of a painful Day.” 27. The disbelieving chiefs of\nhis people said, “We see you only as a human being like ourselves, and we\nsee that no one follows you except the lowliest among us, who do so\n˹hastily˺ without thinking.[415] We do not see anything that makes ˹all of˺\nyou any better than us. In fact, we think you are liars.”\nNoah’s Argument\n28. He said, “O my people! Consider if I stand on a clear proof from my\nLord and He has blessed me with a mercy from Himself,[416] which you fail\nto see. Should we ˹then˺ force it on you against your will? 29. O my people!\nI do not ask you for a payment for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from\n\n-- 198 of 694 --\n\nAllah. And I will never dismiss the believers, for they will surely meet their\nLord. But I can see that you are a people acting ignorantly. 30. O my\npeople! Who would protect me from Allah if I were to dismiss them? Will\nyou not then be mindful? 31. I do not say to you that I possess Allah’s\ntreasuries or know the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel, nor do I say\nthat Allah will never grant goodness to those you look down upon. Allah\nknows best what is ˹hidden˺ within them. ˹If I did,˺ then I would truly be\none of the wrongdoers.”\nHis People’s Response\n32. They protested, “O Noah! You have argued with us far too much, so\nbring upon us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true.” 33. He\nresponded, “It is Allah Who can bring it upon you if He wills, and then you\nwill have no escape! 34. My advice will not benefit you—no matter how\nhard I try—if Allah wills ˹for˺ you to stray. He is your Lord, and to Him you\nwill ˹all˺ be returned.”\nThe Pagans Discredit the Quran\n35. Or do they say, “He[417] has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“If I have done so, then I bear the burden of that sin! But I am free from\nyour sinful accusation.”\nThe Ark\n36. And it was revealed to Noah, “None of your people will believe except\nthose who already have. So do not be distressed by what they have been\ndoing. 37. And build the Ark under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes and directions, and\ndo not plead with Me for those who have done wrong, for they will surely\nbe drowned.” 38. So he began to build the Ark, and whenever some of the\nchiefs of his people passed by, they mocked him. He said, “If you laugh at\nus, we will ˹soon˺ laugh at you similarly. 39. You will soon come to know\nwho will be visited by a humiliating torment ˹in this life˺ and overwhelmed\nby an everlasting punishment ˹in the next˺.”\nThe Flood\n40. And when Our command came and the oven burst ˹with water˺,[418] We\nsaid ˹to Noah˺, “Take into the Ark a pair from every species along with your\nfamily—except those against whom the decree ˹to drown˺ has already been\npassed—and those who believe.” But none believed with him except for a\n\n-- 199 of 694 --\n\nfew. 41. And he said, “Board it! In the Name of Allah it will sail and cast\nanchor. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”\nNoah’s Son\n42. And ˹so˺ the Ark sailed with them through waves like mountains. Noah\ncalled out to his son, who stood apart, “O my dear son! Come aboard with\nus and do not be with the disbelievers.” 43. He replied, “I will take refuge\non a mountain, which will protect me from the water.” Noah cried, “Today\nno one is protected from Allah’s decree except those to whom He shows\nmercy!” And the waves came between them, and his son was among the\ndrowned. 44. And it was said, “O earth! Swallow up your water. And O\nsky! Withhold ˹your rain˺.” The floodwater receded and the decree was\ncarried out. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and it was said, “Away with the\nwrongdoing people!”\nNoah Pleading for His Son\n45. Noah called out to his Lord, saying, “My Lord! Certainly my son is\n˹also˺ of my family, Your promise is surely true, and You are the most just\nof all judges!” 46. Allah replied, “O Noah! He is certainly not of your\nfamily—he was entirely of unrighteous conduct. So do not ask Me about\nwhat you have no knowledge of! I warn you so you do not fall into\nignorance.” 47. Noah pleaded, “My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking\nYou about what I have no knowledge of, and unless You forgive me and\nhave mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.” 48. It was said, “O Noah!\nDisembark with Our peace and blessings on you and some of the\ndescendants of those with you. As for the others, We will allow them ˹a\nbrief˺ enjoyment, then they will be touched with a painful punishment from\nUs.”\nStories of the Past\n49. This is one of the stories of the unseen, which we reveal to you ˹O\nProphet˺. Neither you nor your people knew it before this. So be patient!\nSurely the ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.\nProphet Hûd\n50. And to the people of ’Âd We sent their brother Hûd. He said, “O my\npeople! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. You do nothing\nbut fabricate lies ˹against Allah˺. 51. O my people! I do not ask you for any\n\n-- 200 of 694 --\n\nreward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the One Who created\nme. Will you not then understand? 52. And O my people! Seek your Lord’s\nforgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. He will shower you with rain in\nabundance, and add strength to your strength. So do not turn away,\npersisting in wickedness.”\nHis People’s Response and His Argument\n53. They argued, “O Hûd! You have not given us any clear proof, and we\nwill never abandon our gods upon your word, nor will we believe in you.\n54. All we can say is that some of our gods have possessed you with evil.”\nHe said, “I call Allah to witness, and you too bear witness, that I ˹totally˺\nreject whatever you associate 55. with Him ˹in worship˺. So let all of you\nplot against me without delay! 56. I have put my trust in Allah—my Lord\nand your Lord. There is no living creature that is not completely under His\ncontrol.[419] Surely my Lord’s Way is perfect justice.[420] 57. But if you turn\naway, I have already delivered to you what I have been sent with. My Lord\nwill replace you with others. You are not harming Him in the least. Indeed,\nmy Lord is a ˹vigilant˺ Keeper over all things.”\nThe Torment\n58. When Our command came, We rescued Hûd and those who believed\nwith him by a mercy from Us, saving them from a harsh torment. 59. That\nwas ’Âd. They denied the signs of their Lord, disobeyed His messengers,\n[421] and followed the command of every stubborn tyrant. 60. They were\nfollowed by a curse in this world, as they will be on the Day of Judgment.\nSurely ’Âd denied their Lord. So away with ’Âd, the people of Hûd.\nProphet\nṢâli\nḥ\n61. And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O\nmy people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. He ˹is the One\nWho˺ produced you from the earth and settled you on it. So seek His\nforgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is Ever Near,\nAll-Responsive ˹to prayers˺.”\nHis People’s Argument\n62. They argued, “O Ṣâliḥ! We truly had high hopes in you before this.[422]\nHow dare you forbid us to worship what our forefathers had worshipped?\nWe are certainly in alarming doubt about what you are inviting us to.”\n\n-- 201 of 694 --\n\nHis Response\n63. He responded, “O my people! Consider if I stand on a clear proof from\nmy Lord and He has blessed me with a mercy from Him. Who could help\nme against Allah if I were to disobey Him? You would only contribute to\nmy doom. 64. And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you.\n[423] So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on Allah’s earth and do her no harm, or a\nswift punishment will overtake you!” 65. But they killed her, so he warned\n˹them˺, “You have ˹only˺ three ˹more˺ days to enjoy life in your homes—\nthis is an unfailing promise!”\nThe Torment\n66. When Our command came, We saved Ṣâliḥ and those who believed\nwith him by a mercy from Us and spared them the disgrace of that Day.\nSurely your Lord ˹alone˺ is the All-Powerful, Almighty. 67. And the\n˹mighty˺ blast overtook the wrongdoers, so they fell lifeless in their homes,\n68. as if they had never lived there. Surely Thamûd denied their Lord, so\naway with Thamûd!\nAbraham Visited by Angels\n69. And surely Our messenger-angels came to Abraham with good news ˹of\na son˺. They greeted ˹him with˺, “Peace!” And he replied, “Peace ˹be upon\nyou˺!” Then it was not long before he brought ˹them˺ a ˹fat,˺ roasted calf.\n70. And when he saw that their hands did not reach for the food, he became\nsuspicious and fearful of them.[424] They reassured ˹him˺, “Do not be afraid!\nWe are ˹angels˺ sent ˹only˺ against the people of Lot.”\nGood News to Sarah\n71. And his wife was standing by, so she laughed,[425] then We gave her\ngood news of ˹the birth of˺ Isaac, and, after him, Jacob. 72. She wondered,\n“Oh, my! How can I have a child in this old age, and my husband here is an\nold man? This is truly an astonishing thing!” 73. They responded, “Are you\nastonished by Allah’s decree? May Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon\nyou, O people of this house. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.”\nAbraham Pleading for Lot’s People\n74. Then after the fear had left Abraham, and the good news had reached\nhim, he began to plead with Us for the people of Lot. 75. Truly, Abraham\nwas forbearing, tender-hearted, and ever turning ˹to his Lord˺. 76. ˹The\n\n-- 202 of 694 --\n\nangels said,˺ “O Abraham! Plead no more! Your Lord’s decree has already\ncome, and they will certainly be afflicted with a punishment that cannot be\naverted!”\nLot’s Handsome Guests\n77. When Our messenger-angels came to Lot, he was distressed and\nworried by their arrival.[426] He said, “This is a terrible day.” 78. And ˹the\nmen of˺ his people—who were used to shameful deeds—came to him\nrushing. He pleaded, “O my people! Here are my daughters[427] ˹for\nmarriage˺—they are pure for you. So fear Allah, and do not humiliate me by\ndisrespecting my guests. Is there not ˹even˺ a single right-minded man\namong you?” 79. They argued, “You certainly know that we have no need\nfor your daughters. You already know what we desire!” 80. He responded,\n“If only I had the strength ˹to resist you˺ or could rely on a strong\nsupporter.”\nReassuring Lot\n81. The angels said, “O Lot! We are the messengers of your Lord. They will\nnever reach you. So travel with your family in the dark of night, and do not\nlet any of you look back, except your wife. She will certainly suffer the fate\nof the others.[428] Their appointed time is the morning. Is the morning not\nnear?”\nThe Torment\n82. When Our command came, We turned the cities upside down and rained\ndown on them clustered stones of baked clay, 83. marked by your Lord ˹O\nProphet˺. And these stones are not far from the ˹pagan˺ wrongdoers!\nProphet Shu’aib\n84. And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O\nmy people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. And do not\ngive short measure and weight. I do see you in prosperity now, but I truly\nfear for you the torment of an overwhelming Day. 85. O my people! Give\nfull measure and weigh with justice. Do not defraud people of their\nproperty, nor go about spreading corruption in the land. 86. What is left ˹as\na lawful gain˺ by Allah is far better for you if you are ˹truly˺ believers. And\nI am not a keeper over you.”\nHis People’s Response\n\n-- 203 of 694 --\n\n87. They asked ˹sarcastically˺, “O Shu’aib! Does your prayer command you\nthat we should abandon what our forefathers worshipped or give up\nmanaging our wealth as we please? Indeed, you are such a tolerant, sensible\nman!”\nShu’aib’s Argument\n88. He said, “O my people! Consider if I stand on a clear proof from my\nLord and He has blessed me with a good provision from Him. I do not want\nto do what I am forbidding you from. I only intend reform to the best of my\nability. My success comes only through Allah. In Him I trust and to Him I\nturn. 89. O my people! Do not let your opposition to me lead you to a fate\nsimilar to that of the people of Noah, or Hûd, or Ṣâliḥ. And the people of\nLot are not far from you.[429] 90. So seek your Lord’s forgiveness and turn\nto Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is Most Merciful, All-Loving.”\nThe Threat\n91. They threatened, “O Shu’aib! We do not comprehend much of what you\nsay, and surely we see you powerless among us. Were it not for your clan,\nwe would have certainly stoned you, for you are nothing to us.”\nShu’aib’s Response\n92. He said, “O my people! Do you have more regard for my clan than for\nAllah, turning your back on Him entirely? Surely my Lord is Fully Aware\nof what you do. 93. O my people! Persist in your ways, for I ˹too˺ will\npersist in mine. You will soon come to know who will be visited by a\nhumiliating torment and is a liar! And watch! I too am watching with you!”\nThe Torment\n94. When Our command came, We saved Shu’aib and those who believed\nwith him by a mercy from Us. And the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook the\nwrongdoers, so they fell lifeless in their homes, 95. as if they had never\nlived there. So away with Midian as it was with Thamûd!\nProphet Moses\n96. Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs and compelling proof 97. to\nPharaoh and his chiefs, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and\nPharaoh’s command was not well guided. 98. He will be before his people\non the Day of Judgment and will lead them into the Fire. What an evil place\n\n-- 204 of 694 --\n\nto be led into! 99. They were followed by a curse in this ˹life˺ and ˹will\nreceive another˺ on the Day of Judgment. What an evil gift to receive!\nReward of Wickedness\n100. These are accounts, We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺, of the ˹destroyed˺\ncities. Some are still standing ˹barren˺, while others have been mowed\ndown. 101. We did not wrong them, rather they wronged themselves. The\ngods they invoked beside Allah were of no help at all when the command of\nyour Lord came, and only contributed to their ruin. 102. Such is the\n˹crushing˺ grip of your Lord when He seizes the societies entrenched in\nwrongdoing. Indeed, His grip is ˹terribly˺ painful and severe.\nJudgment Day\n103. Surely in this is a sign for those who fear the torment of the Hereafter.\nThat is a Day for which humanity will be gathered and a Day ˹that will be˺\nwitnessed ˹by all˺. 104. We only delay it for a fixed term. 105. When that\nDay arrives, no one will dare speak except with His permission. Some of\nthem will be miserable, others joyful.\nThe Miserable\n106. As for those bound for misery, they will be in the Fire, where they will\nbe sighing and gasping, 107. staying there forever, as long as the heavens\nand the earth will endure, except what your Lord wills.[430] Surely your\nLord does what He intends.\nThe Joyful\n108. And as for those destined to joy, they will be in Paradise, staying there\nforever, as long as the heavens and the earth will endure, except what your\nLord wills[431]—a ˹generous˺ giving, without end.\nBlind Following\n109. So do not be in doubt ˹O Prophet˺ about what those ˹pagans˺ worship.\nThey worship nothing except what their forefathers worshipped before\n˹them˺. And We will certainly give them their share ˹of punishment˺ in full,\nwithout any reduction.\nThe Torah\n110. Indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture, but differences arose\nregarding it. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord,[432] their\ndifferences would have been settled ˹at once˺. They are truly in alarming\n\n-- 205 of 694 --\n\ndoubt about it. 111. And surely your Lord will fully pay all for their deeds.\nHe is certainly All-Aware of what they do.\nAdvice to the Believers\n112. So be steadfast as you are commanded ˹O Prophet˺, along with those\nwho turn ˹in submission to Allah˺ with you. And do not transgress. Surely\nHe is All-Seeing of what you ˹believers˺ do. 113. And do not be inclined to\nthe wrongdoers or you will be touched by the Fire. For then you would have\nno protectors other than Allah, nor would you be helped. 114. Establish\nprayer ˹O Prophet˺ at both ends of the day and in the early part of the night.\n[433] Surely good deeds wipe out evil deeds. That is a reminder for the\nmindful. 115. And be patient! Certainly Allah does not discount the reward\nof the good-doers.\nSpeaking out Against Evil\n116. If only there had been among the ˹destroyed˺ peoples before you, ˹O\nbelievers,˺ virtuous individuals who forbade corruption in the land—other\nthan the few We had saved ˹from the torment˺. But the wrongdoers ˹only˺\npursued their ˹worldly˺ pleasures, becoming wicked. 117. And your Lord ˹O\nProphet˺ would never destroy a society unjustly while its people were acting\nrightly.\nFree Choice\n118. Had your Lord so willed, He would have certainly made humanity one\nsingle community ˹of believers˺, but they will always ˹choose to˺ differ—\n119. except those shown mercy by your Lord—and so He created them ˹to\nchoose freely˺. And so the Word of your Lord will be fulfilled: “I will\nsurely fill up Hell with jinn and humans all together.”\nMoral of the Stories\n120. And We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ the stories of the messengers to\nreassure your heart. And there has come to you in this ˹sûrah˺ the truth, a\nwarning ˹to the disbelievers˺, and a reminder to the believers. 121. Say to\nthose who disbelieve, “Persist in your ways; we will certainly persist in\nours. 122. And wait! Surely we ˹too˺ are waiting.”\nAllah Almighty\n123. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the knowledge of what is hidden in the\nheavens and the earth. And to Him all matters are returned. So worship Him\n\n-- 206 of 694 --\n\nand put your trust in Him. And your Lord is never unaware of what you do.\n***\n\n-- 207 of 694 --\n\n12. Joseph\n(Yûsuf)\nRightfully called ‘the best of stories,’ this uplifting Meccan sûrah was\nrevealed along with the two previous sûrahs at a critical time in the life of\nthe Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) following the death of his wife Khadîjah and his uncle\nAbu\nṬâlib, his two main supporters, shortly after a 3-year boycott by the\nMeccan pagans to suppress the believers. This is the story of Joseph\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) whose half-brothers were driven by jealousy, conspiring to\ndistance him from his father Jacob (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Joseph was sold into slavery\nin Egypt, falsely accused, and imprisoned for several years, only to become\nEgypt’s Chief Minister. Just like Joseph (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had\nto live away from his hometown, was faced with false allegations and\nabused by his own people, but ultimately became Arabia’s undisputed\nleader. When the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) triumphed over Mecca after many years\nof persecution, he treated the very people who abused him with grace,\nrecalling the words of Joseph when his brothers begged for mercy in verse\n92, “There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you! He is the Most\nMerciful of the merciful!”\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Best of Stories\n1. Alif-Lãm-Ra. These are the verses of the clear Book. 2. Indeed, We have\nsent it down as an Arabic Quran[434] so that you may understand.[435] 3. We\nrelate to you ˹O Prophet˺ the best of stories through Our revelation of this\nQuran, though before this you were totally unaware ˹of them˺.\nJoseph’s Dream\n4. ˹Remember˺ when Joseph said to his father, “O my dear father! Indeed I\ndreamt of eleven stars, and the sun, and the moon—I saw them prostrating\nto me!”[436] 5. He replied, “O my dear son! Do not relate your vision to\nyour brothers, or they will devise a plot against you. Surely Satan is a sworn\nenemy to humankind. 6. And so will your Lord choose you ˹O Joseph˺, and\nteach you the interpretation of dreams, and perfect His favour upon you and\n\n-- 208 of 694 --\n\nthe descendants of Jacob—˹just˺ as He once perfected it upon your\nforefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Surely your Lord is All-Knowing, All-\nWise.”\nConspiracy by Joseph’s Brothers\n7. Indeed, in the story of Joseph and his brothers there are lessons for all\nwho ask. 8. ˹Remember˺ when they said ˹to one another˺, “Surely Joseph\nand his brother ˹Benjamin˺ are more beloved to our father than we, even\nthough we are a group of so many.[437] Indeed, our father is clearly\nmistaken. 9. Kill Joseph or cast him out to some ˹distant˺ land so that our\nfather’s attention will be only ours, then after that you may ˹repent and˺\nbecome righteous people!” 10. One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph. But if\nyou must do something, throw him into the bottom of a well so perhaps he\nmay be picked up by some travellers.”\nConvincing Jacob\n11. They said, “O our father! Why do you not trust us with Joseph, although\nwe truly wish him well? 12. Send him out with us tomorrow so that he may\nenjoy himself and play. And we will really watch over him.” 13. He\nresponded, “It would truly sadden me if you took him away with you, and I\nfear that a wolf may devour him while you are negligent of him.” 14. They\nsaid, “If a wolf were to devour him, despite our strong group, then we\nwould certainly be losers!” 15. And so, when they took him away and\ndecided to throw him into the bottom of the well, We inspired him: “˹One\nday˺ you will remind them of this deed of theirs while they are unaware ˹of\nwho you are˺.”\nFaking Joseph’s Death\n16. Then they returned to their father in the evening, weeping. 17. They\ncried, “Our father! We went racing and left Joseph with our belongings, and\na wolf devoured him! But you will not believe us, no matter how truthful\nwe are.” 18. And they brought his shirt, stained with false blood.[438] He\nresponded, “No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something ˹evil˺.\nSo ˹I can only endure with˺ beautiful patience![439] It is Allah’s help that I\nseek to bear your claims.”\nJoseph Sold into Slavery\n\n-- 209 of 694 --\n\n19. And there came some travellers, and they sent their water-boy who let\ndown his bucket into the well. He cried out, “Oh, what a great find! Here is\na boy!” And they took him secretly ˹to be sold˺ as merchandise, but Allah is\nAll-Knowing of what they did. 20. They ˹later˺ sold him for a cheap price,\njust a few silver coins—only wanting to get rid of him.[440]\nJoseph in Egypt\n21. The man from Egypt[441] who bought him said to his wife, “Take good\ncare of him, perhaps he may be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son.”\nThis is how We established Joseph in the land, so that We might teach him\nthe interpretation of dreams. Allah’s Will always prevails, but most people\ndo not know. 22. And when he reached maturity, We gave him wisdom and\nknowledge. This is how We reward the good-doers.\nThe Temptation\n23. And the lady, in whose house he lived, tried to seduce him. She locked\nthe doors ˹firmly˺ and said, “Come to me!” He replied, “Allah is my refuge!\nIt is ˹not right to betray˺ my master, who has taken good care of me. Indeed,\nthe wrongdoers never succeed.” 24. She advanced towards him, and he\nwould have done likewise, had he not seen a sign from his Lord.[442] This is\nhow We kept evil and indecency away from him, for he was truly one of\nOur chosen servants. 25. They raced for the door and she tore his shirt from\nthe back, only to find her husband at the door. She cried, “What is the\npenalty for someone who tried to violate your wife, except imprisonment or\na painful punishment?”\nThe Witness\n26. Joseph responded, “It was she who tried to seduce me.” And a witness\nfrom her own family testified: “If his shirt is torn from the front, then she\nhas told the truth and he is a liar. 27. But if it is torn from the back, then she\nhas lied and he is truthful.” 28. So when her husband saw that Joseph’s shirt\nwas torn from the back, he said ˹to her˺, “This must be ˹an example˺ of the\ncunning of you ˹women˺! Indeed, your cunning is so shrewd! 29. O Joseph!\nForget about this. And you ˹O wife˺! Seek forgiveness for your sin.[443] It\ncertainly has been your fault.”\nThe Women and Joseph’s Beauty\n\n-- 210 of 694 --\n\n30. Some women of the city gossiped, “The Chief Minister’s wife is trying\nto seduce her slave-boy. Love for him has plagued her heart. Indeed, we see\nthat she is clearly mistaken.”[444] 31. When she heard about their gossip,\n[445] she invited them and set a banquet for them. She gave each one a knife,\nthen said ˹to Joseph˺, “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they\nwere so stunned ˹by his beauty˺ that they cut their hands,[446] and\nexclaimed, “Good God! This cannot be human; this must be a noble angel!”\n32. She said, “This is the one for whose love you criticized me! I did try to\nseduce him but he ˹firmly˺ refused. And if he does not do what I order him\nto, he will certainly be imprisoned and ˹fully˺ disgraced.”[447]\nThe Lesser of Two Evils\n33. Joseph prayed, “My Lord! I would rather be in jail than do what they\ninvite me to. And if You do not turn their cunning away from me, I might\nyield to them and fall into ignorance.” 34. So his Lord responded to him,\nturning their cunning away from him. Surely He is the All-Hearing, All-\nKnowing. 35. And so it occurred to those in charge, despite seeing all the\nproofs ˹of his innocence˺, that he should be imprisoned for a while.[448]\nDreams of the Two Inmates\n36. And two other servants went to jail with Joseph. One of them said, “I\ndreamt I was pressing wine.” The other said, “I dreamt I was carrying\n˹some˺ bread on my head, from which birds were eating.” ˹Then both said,˺\n“Tell us their interpretation, for we surely see you as one of the good-\ndoers.”\nInvitation to the Truth\n37. Joseph replied, “I can even tell you what kind of meal you will be\nserved before you receive it. This ˹knowledge˺ is from what my Lord has\ntaught me. I have shunned the faith of a people who disbelieve in Allah and\ndeny the Hereafter. 38. I follow the faith of my fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and\nJacob. It is not ˹right˺ for us to associate anything with Allah ˹in worship˺.\nThis is part of Allah’s grace upon us and humanity, but most people are not\ngrateful. 39. O my fellow-prisoners! Which is far better: many different\nlords or Allah—the One, the Supreme? 40. Whatever ˹idols˺ you worship\ninstead of Him are mere names which you and your forefathers have made\nup[449]—a practice Allah has never authorized. It is only Allah Who\n\n-- 211 of 694 --\n\ndecides. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the\nupright faith, but most people do not know.\nInterpretation of the Dreams\n41. “O my fellow-prisoners! ˹The first˺ one of you will serve wine to his\nmaster, and the other will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head.\nThe matter about which you inquired has been decided.” 42. Then he said to\nthe one he knew would survive, “Mention me in the presence of your\nmaster.[450]” But Satan made him forget to mention Joseph to his master, so\nhe remained in prison for several years.\nThe King’s Dream\n43. And ˹one day˺ the King[451] said, “I dreamt of seven fat cows eaten up\nby seven skinny ones; and seven green ears of grain and ˹seven˺ others dry.\nO chiefs! Tell me the meaning of my dream if you can interpret dreams.”\n44. They replied, “These are confused visions and we do not know the\ninterpretation of such dreams.” 45. ˹Finally,˺ the surviving ex-prisoner\nremembered ˹Joseph˺ after a long time and said, “I will tell you its\ninterpretation, so send me forth ˹to Joseph˺.”\nInterpretation of the King’s Dream\n46. ˹He said,˺ “Joseph, O man of truth! Interpret for us ˹the dream of˺ seven\nfat cows eaten up by seven skinny ones; and seven green ears of grain and\n˹seven˺ others dry, so that I may return to the people and let them know.”\n47. Joseph replied, “You will plant ˹grain˺ for seven consecutive years,\nleaving in the ear whatever you will harvest, except for the little you will\neat. 48. Then after that will come seven years of great hardship which will\nconsume whatever you have saved, except the little you will store ˹for\nseed˺. 49. Then after that will come a year in which people will receive\nabundant rain and they will press ˹oil and wine˺.”\nJoseph Declared Innocent\n50. The King ˹then˺ said, “Bring him to me.” When the messenger came to\nhim, Joseph said, “Go back to your master and ask him about the case of the\nwomen who cut their hands. Surely my Lord has ˹full˺ knowledge of their\ncunning.” 51. The King asked ˹the women˺, “What did you get when you\ntried to seduce Joseph?” They replied, “Allah forbid! We know nothing\nindecent about him.” Then the Chief Minister’s wife admitted, “Now the\n\n-- 212 of 694 --\n\ntruth has come to light. It was I who tried to seduce him, and he is surely\ntruthful. 52. From this, Joseph should know that I did not speak dishonestly\nabout him in his absence, for Allah certainly does not guide the scheming of\nthe dishonest. 53. And I do not seek to free myself from blame, for indeed\nthe soul is ever inclined to evil, except those shown mercy by my Lord.\nSurely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”\nJoseph, the Chief Minister\n54. The King said, “Bring him to me. I will employ him exclusively in my\nservice.” And when Joseph spoke to him, the King said, “Today you are\nhighly esteemed and fully trusted by us.” 55. Joseph proposed, “Put me in\ncharge of the store-houses of the land, for I am truly reliable and adept.” 56.\nThis is how We established Joseph in the land to settle wherever he pleased.\nWe shower Our mercy on whoever We will, and We never discount the\nreward of the good-doers. 57. And the reward of the Hereafter is far better\nfor those who are faithful and are mindful ˹of Allah˺.\nJoseph’s Brothers Visit Egypt[452]\n58. And Joseph’s brothers came and entered his presence. He recognized\nthem but they were unaware of who he really was. 59. When he had\nprovided them with their supplies, he demanded, “Bring me your brother on\nyour father’s side.[453] Do you not see that I give full measure and I am the\nbest of hosts? 60. But if you do not bring him to me ˹next time˺, I will have\nno grain for you, nor will you ever come close to me again.” 61. They\npromised, “We will try to convince his father to let him come. We will\ncertainly do ˹our best˺.” 62. Joseph ordered his servants to put his brothers’\nmoney back into their saddlebags so that they would find it when they\nreturned to their family and perhaps they would come back.\nThe Brothers Return Home\n63. When Joseph’s brothers returned to their father, they pleaded, “O our\nfather! We have been denied ˹further˺ supplies. So send our brother with us\nso that we may receive our measure, and we will definitely watch over\nhim.” 64. He responded, “Should I trust you with him as I once trusted you\nwith his brother ˹Joseph˺? But ˹only˺ Allah is the best Protector, and He is\nthe Most Merciful of the merciful.” 65. When they opened their bags, they\ndiscovered that their money had been returned to them. They argued, “O\n\n-- 213 of 694 --\n\nour father! What more can we ask for? Here is our money, fully returned to\nus. Now we can buy more food for our family. We will watch over our\nbrother, and obtain an extra camel-load of grain. That load can be easily\nsecured.”\nJacob’s Wisdom\n66. Jacob insisted, “I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn\noath by Allah that you will certainly bring him back to me, unless you are\ntotally overpowered.” Then after they had given him their oaths, he\nconcluded, “Allah is a Witness to what we have said.” 67. He then\ninstructed ˹them˺, “O my sons! Do not enter ˹the city˺ all through one gate,\nbut through separate gates.[454] I cannot help you against ˹what is destined\nby˺ Allah in the least. It is only Allah Who decides. In Him I put my trust.\nAnd in Him let the faithful put their trust.” 68. Then when they entered as\ntheir father had instructed them, this did not help them against ˹the Will of˺\nAllah whatsoever. It was just a desire in Jacob’s heart which he satisfied. He\nwas truly blessed with ˹great˺ knowledge because of what We had taught\nhim, but most people have no knowledge.\nThe Royal Cup[455]\n69. When they entered Joseph’s presence, he called his brother ˹Benjamin˺\naside, and confided ˹to him˺, “I am indeed your brother ˹Joseph˺! So do not\nfeel distressed about what they have been doing.” 70. When Joseph had\nprovided them with supplies, he slipped the royal cup into his brother’s bag.\nThen a herald cried, “O people of the caravan! You must be thieves!” 71.\nThey asked, turning back, “What have you lost?” 72. The herald ˹along with\nthe guards˺ replied, “We have lost the King’s measuring cup. And whoever\nbrings it will be awarded a camel-load ˹of grain˺. I guarantee it.” 73.\nJoseph’s brothers replied, “By Allah! You know well that we did not come\nto cause trouble in the land, nor are we thieves.” 74. Joseph’s men asked,\n“What should be the price for theft, if you are lying?” 75. Joseph’s brothers\nresponded, “The price will be ˹the enslavement of˺ the one in whose bag the\ncup is found. That is how we punish the wrongdoers.”\nJoseph Takes Benjamin\n76. Joseph began searching their bags before that of his brother ˹Benjamin˺,\nthen brought it out of Benjamin’s bag. This is how We inspired Joseph to\n\n-- 214 of 694 --\n\nplan. He could not have taken his brother under the King’s law, but Allah\nhad so willed. We elevate in rank whoever We will. But above those\nranking in knowledge is the One All-Knowing. 77. ˹To distance\nthemselves,˺ Joseph’s brothers argued, “If he has stolen, so did his ˹full˺\nbrother before.”[456] But Joseph suppressed his outrage—revealing nothing\nto them—and said ˹to himself˺, “You are in such an evil position,[457] and\nAllah knows best ˹the truth of˺ what you claim.” 78. They appealed, “O\nChief Minister! He has a very old father, so take one of us instead. We\nsurely see you as one of the good-doers.” 79. Joseph responded, “Allah\nforbid that we should take other than the one with whom we found our\nproperty. Otherwise, we would surely be unjust.”\nBad News for Jacob, Again\n80. When they lost all hope in him, they spoke privately. The eldest of them\nsaid, “Do you not know that your father had taken a solemn oath by Allah\nfrom you, nor how you failed him regarding Joseph before? So I am not\nleaving this land until my father allows me to, or Allah decides for me. For\nHe is the Best of Judges. 81. Return to your father and say, ‘O our father!\nYour son committed theft. We testify only to what we know. We could not\nguard against the unforeseen.[458] 82. Ask ˹the people of˺ the land where we\nwere and the caravan we travelled with. We are certainly telling the truth.’”\nJacob’s Grief\n83. He cried, “No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something\n˹evil˺. So ˹I am left with nothing but˺ beautiful patience![459] I trust Allah\nwill return them all to me. Surely He ˹alone˺ is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.”\n84. He turned away from them, lamenting, “Alas, poor Joseph!” And his\neyes turned white out of the grief he suppressed.[460] 85. They said, “By\nAllah! You will not cease to remember Joseph until you lose your health or\n˹even˺ your life.” 86. He replied, “I complain of my anguish and sorrow\nonly to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know. 87. O my\nsons! Go and search ˹diligently˺ for Joseph and his brother. And do not lose\nhope in the mercy of Allah, for no one loses hope in Allah’s mercy except\nthose with no faith.”\nJoseph Reveals His Identity\n\n-- 215 of 694 --\n\n88. When they entered Joseph’s presence, they pleaded, “O Chief Minister!\nWe and our family have been touched with hardship, and we have brought\nonly a few worthless coins, but ˹please˺ give us our supplies in full and be\ncharitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable.” 89. He asked, “Do\nyou remember what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?”\n90. They replied ˹in shock˺, “Are you really Joseph?” He said, “I am\nJoseph, and here is my brother ˹Benjamin˺! Allah has truly been gracious to\nus. Surely whoever is mindful ˹of Allah˺ and patient, then certainly Allah\nnever discounts the reward of the good-doers.”\nBrothers’ Apology Accepted\n91. They admitted, “By Allah! Allah has truly preferred you over us, and\nwe have surely been sinful.” 92. Joseph said, “There is no blame on you\ntoday. May Allah forgive you! He is the Most Merciful of the merciful! 93.\nGo with this shirt of mine and cast it over my father’s face, and he will\nregain his sight. Then come back to me with your whole family.”\nJacob Regains His Sight\n94. When the caravan departed ˹from Egypt˺, their father said ˹to those\naround him˺, “You may think I am senile, but I certainly sense the smell of\nJoseph.” 95. They replied, “By Allah! You are definitely still in your old\ndelusion.” 96. But when the bearer of the good news arrived, he cast the\nshirt over Jacob’s face, so he regained his sight. Jacob then said ˹to his\nchildren˺, “Did I not tell you that I truly know from Allah what you do not\nknow?” 97. They begged, “O our father! Pray for the forgiveness of our\nsins. We have certainly been sinful.” 98. He said, “I will pray to my Lord\nfor your forgiveness.[461] He ˹alone˺ is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful.”\nJoseph’s Dream Comes True\n99. When they entered Joseph’s presence, he received his parents\n˹graciously˺ and said, “Enter Egypt, Allah willing, in security.” 100. Then\nhe raised his parents to the throne, and they all fell down in prostration to\nJoseph,[462] who then said, “O my dear father! This is the interpretation of\nmy old dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was truly kind to me\nwhen He freed me from prison, and brought you all from the desert after\nSatan had ignited rivalry between me and my siblings.[463] Indeed my Lord\n\n-- 216 of 694 --\n\nis subtle in fulfilling what He wills. Surely He ˹alone˺ is the All-Knowing,\nAll-Wise.”\nJoseph’s Prayer\n101. “My Lord! You have surely granted me authority and taught me the\ninterpretation of dreams. ˹O˺ Originator of the heavens and the earth! You\nare my Guardian in this world and the Hereafter. Allow me to die as one\nwho submits[464] and join me with the righteous.”\nReminders to Prophet Mu\nḥammad\n102. That is from the stories of the unseen which We reveal to you ˹O\nProphet˺. You were not present when they ˹all˺[465] made up their minds,\nand when they plotted ˹against Joseph˺. 103. And most people will not\nbelieve—no matter how keen you are— 104. even though you are not\nasking them for a reward for this ˹Quran˺. It is only a reminder to the whole\nworld. 105. How many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by\nwith indifference! 106. And most of them do not believe in Allah without\nassociating others with Him ˹in worship˺. 107. Do they feel secure that an\noverwhelming torment from Allah will not overtake them, or that the Hour\nwill not take them by surprise when they least expect ˹it˺?\nInvitation with Knowledge and Wisdom\n108. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “This is my way. I invite to Allah with insight—I and\nthose who follow me. Glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the\npolytheists.”\nAllah’s Messengers\n109. We only sent before you ˹O Prophet˺ men inspired by Us from among\nthe people of each society. Have the deniers not travelled through the land\nto see what was the end of those ˹destroyed˺ before them? And surely the\n˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺.\nWill you not then understand? 110. And when the messengers despaired and\ntheir people thought the messengers had been denied help, Our help came to\nthem ˹at last˺. We then saved whoever We willed, and Our punishment is\nnever averted from the wicked people.\nMessengers’ Stories in the Quran\n111. In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason. This\nmessage cannot be a fabrication, rather ˹it is˺ a confirmation of previous\n\n-- 217 of 694 --\n\nrevelation, a detailed explanation of all things, a guide, and a mercy for\npeople of faith.\n***\n\n-- 218 of 694 --\n\n13. Thunder\n(Ar-Ra’d)\nThis sûrah, which takes its name from the thunder in verse 13, elaborates\nupon the last verses of the previous sûrah (starting with 105) relating to\nAllah’s magnificent signs in the heavens and earth which are met with\nneglect by the deniers; Allah’s knowledge, might, and unwavering support\nfor His prophets; the authenticity of the Quran; and warnings to the\ndisbelievers. The sûrah touches on the qualities of the believers and the\ndisbelievers and the reward for each. All these themes are reiterated in the\nnext two sûrahs.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Truth\n1. Alif-Lãm-Mĩm-Ra. These are the verses of the Book. What has been\nrevealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ from your Lord is the truth, but most people do\nnot believe.\nAllah’s Might\n2. It is Allah Who has raised the heavens without pillars—as you can see—\nthen established Himself on the Throne. He has subjected the sun and the\nmoon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He conducts the whole affair.\nHe makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with\nyour Lord. 3. And He is the One Who spread out the earth and placed firm\nmountains and rivers upon it, and created fruits of every kind in pairs.[466]\nHe covers the day with night. Surely in this are signs for those who reflect.\n4. And on the earth there are ˹different˺ neighbouring tracts, gardens of\ngrapevines, ˹various˺ crops, palm trees—some stemming from the same\nroot, others standing alone. They are all irrigated with the same water, yet\nWe make some taste better than others. Surely in this are signs for those\nwho understand.\nDenying Resurrection\n5. ˹Now,˺ if anything should amaze you ˹O Prophet˺, then it is their\nquestion: “When we are reduced to dust, will we really be raised as a new\n\n-- 219 of 694 --\n\ncreation?” It is they who have disbelieved in their Lord. It is they who will\nhave shackles around their necks. And it is they who will be the residents of\nthe Fire. They will be there forever.\nHastening the Torment\n6. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ to hasten the torment rather than grace, though\nthere have ˹already˺ been ˹many˺ torments before them. Surely your Lord is\nfull of forgiveness for people, despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is\ntruly severe in punishment.\nDemanding a Sign from the Prophet[467]\n7. The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his\nLord.” You ˹O Prophet˺ are only a warner. And every people had a guide.\nAllah’s Knowledge\n8. Allah knows what every female bears and what increases and decreases\nin the wombs.[468] And with Him everything is determined with precision.\n9. ˹He is the˺ Knower of the seen and the unseen—the All-Great, Most\nExalted. 10. It is the same ˹to Him˺ whether any of you speaks secretly or\nopenly, whether one hides in the darkness of night or goes about in broad\ndaylight.\nAllah’s Power\n11. For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting\nthem by Allah’s command. Indeed, Allah would never change a people’s\nstate ˹of favour˺ until they change their own state ˹of faith˺. And if it is\nAllah’s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a\nprotector other than Him.\nDisplay of Divine Power\n12. He is the One Who shows you lightning, inspiring ˹you with˺ hope and\nfear,[469] and produces heavy clouds. 13. The thunder glorifies His praises,\nas do the angels in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts, striking with them\nwhoever He wills. Yet they dispute about Allah. And He is tremendous in\nmight.\nUseless Idols\n14. Calling upon Him ˹alone˺ is the truth. But those ˹idols˺ the pagans\ninvoke besides Him ˹can˺ never respond to them in any way. ˹It is˺ just like\n\n-- 220 of 694 --\n\nsomeone who stretches out their hands to water, ˹asking it˺ to reach their\nmouths, but it can never do so. The calls of the disbelievers are only in vain.\nThe True Lord\n15. To Allah ˹alone˺ bow down ˹in submission˺[470] all those in the heavens\nand the earth—willingly or unwillingly—as do their shadows, morning and\nevening.\nAlmighty Allah or Powerless Gods?\n16. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?”\nSay, “Allah!” Ask ˹them˺, “Why ˹then˺ have you taken besides Him lords\nwho cannot even benefit or protect themselves?” Say, “Can the blind and\nthe sighted be equal? Or can darkness and light be equal?”[471] Or have they\nassociated with Allah partners who ˹supposedly˺ produced a creation like\nHis, leaving them confused between the two creations? Say, “Allah is the\nCreator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.”\nParable of Truth and Falsehood\n17. He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each\naccording to its capacity. The currents then carry along rising foam, similar\nto the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire for ornaments or\ntools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood. The ˹worthless˺\nresidue is then cast away, but what benefits people remains on the earth.\nThis is how Allah sets forth parables.\nBlindness to the Truth\n18. Those who respond to ˹the call of˺ their Lord will have the finest\nreward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to\npossess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to\nransom themselves. They will face strict judgment, and Hell will be their\nhome. What an evil place to rest! 19. Can the one who knows that your\nLord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth be like the one who is\nblind? None will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason.\nPeople of Reason\n20. ˹They are˺ those who honour Allah’s covenant, never breaking the\npledge; 21. and those who maintain whatever ˹ties˺ Allah has ordered to be\nmaintained, stand in awe of their Lord, and fear strict judgment. 22. And\n˹they are˺ those who endure patiently, seeking their Lord’s pleasure,[472]\n\n-- 221 of 694 --\n\nestablish prayer, donate from what We have provided for them—secretly\nand openly—and respond to evil with good. It is they who will have the\nultimate abode: 23. the Gardens of Eternity, which they will enter along\nwith the righteous among their parents, spouses, and descendants. And the\nangels will enter upon them from every gate, ˹saying,˺ 24. “Peace be upon\nyou for your perseverance. How excellent is the ultimate abode!”\nThe Wicked\n25. And those who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break\nwhatever ˹ties˺ Allah has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in\nthe land—it is they who will be condemned and will have the worst abode.\n[473]\nWorldly Delusions\n26. Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. And\nthe disbelievers become prideful of ˹the pleasures of˺ this worldly life. But\nthe life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a fleeting\nenjoyment.\nRemembrance of Allah\n27. The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his\nLord.”[474] Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, Allah leaves to stray whoever He\nwills, and guides to Himself whoever turns to Him— 28. those who believe\nand whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in the\nremembrance of Allah do hearts find comfort. 29. Those who believe and\ndo good, for them will be bliss and an honourable destination.”\nDenying the Most Compassionate\n30. And so We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ to a community, like ˹We did\nwith˺ earlier communities, so that you may recite to them what We have\nrevealed to you. Yet they deny the Most Compassionate.[475] Say, “He is my\nLord! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. In Him I put my\ntrust, and to Him I turn ˹in repentance˺.”\nDeniers Will Always Deny\n31. If there were a recitation that could cause mountains to move, or the\nearth to split, or the dead to speak, ˹it would have been this Quran˺. But all\nmatters are by Allah’s Will. Have the believers not yet realized that had\nAllah willed, He could have guided all of humanity? And disasters will\n\n-- 222 of 694 --\n\ncontinue to afflict the disbelievers or strike close to their homes for their\nmisdeeds, until Allah’s promise comes to pass. Surely Allah never fails in\nHis promise. 32. Other messengers had already been ridiculed before you,\nbut I delayed the disbelievers ˹for a while˺ then seized them. And how\n˹horrible˺ was My punishment!\nFalsehood Made Appealing\n33. Is ˹there any equal to˺ the Vigilant One Who knows what every soul\ncommits? Yet the pagans have associated others with Allah ˹in worship˺.\nSay, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Name them! Or do you ˹mean to˺ inform Him of\nsomething He does not know on the earth? Or are these ˹gods˺ just empty\nwords?” In fact, the disbelievers’ falsehood has been made so appealing to\nthem that they have been turned away from the Path. And whoever Allah\nleaves to stray will be left with no guide. 34. For them is punishment in this\nworldly life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is truly far worse. And\nnone can shield them from Allah.\nParadise Described\n35. The description of the Paradise promised to the righteous is that under it\nrivers flow; eternal is its fruit as well as its shade. That is the ˹ultimate˺\noutcome for the righteous. But the outcome for the disbelievers is the Fire!\nEmbracing the Quran\n36. ˹The believers among˺ those who were given the Scripture rejoice at\nwhat has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺, while some ˹disbelieving˺\nfactions deny a portion of it. Say, “I have only been commanded to worship\nAllah, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺. To Him I invite ˹all˺, and to\nHim is my return.” 37. And so We have revealed it as an authority in\nArabic. And if you were to follow their desires after ˹all˺ the knowledge that\nhas come to you, there would be none to protect or shield you from Allah.\nThe Last of Many\n38. We have certainly sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ and blessed\nthem with wives and offspring. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign\nwithout Allah’s permission. Every destined matter has a ˹set˺ time. 39.\nAllah eliminates and confirms what He wills, and with Him is the Master\nRecord.[476]\nDeliver, Not Judge\n\n-- 223 of 694 --\n\n40. Whether We show you ˹O Prophet˺ some of what We threaten them\nwith, or cause you to die ˹before that˺, your duty is only to deliver ˹the\nmessage˺. Judgment is for Us.\nWarning to the Pagans\n41. Do they not see that We gradually reduce their land from its borders?\nAllah decides—none can reverse His decision. And He is swift in\nreckoning. 42. Those ˹disbelievers˺ before them ˹secretly˺ planned, but\nAllah has the ultimate plan. He knows what every soul commits. And the\ndisbelievers will soon know who will have the ultimate outcome. 43. The\ndisbelievers say, “You ˹Muḥammad˺ are no messenger.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Allah is sufficient as a Witness between me and you, as is whoever has\nknowledge of the Scripture.”\n***\n\n-- 224 of 694 --\n\n14. Abraham\n(Ibrâhîm)\nThis Meccan sûrah is named after Prophet Abraham (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) who, upon\nsettling his wife Hagar and his son Ishmael in what later became the city of\nMecca, invokes Allah to protect his descendants from idol-worship, a\npractice that Meccans were entrenched in at the time of this revelation\n(verses 35-41). The sûrah also refers to some of Allah’s favours, which are\nmet with ingratitude and denial. A sizable portion reveals how the\ndisbelievers will be let down by Satan and tormented in Hell, wishing they\nhad believed, according to the next sûrah (15:2).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n1. Alif-Lãm-Ra. ˹This is˺ a Book which We have revealed to you ˹O\nProphet˺ so that you may lead people out of darkness and into light, by the\nWill of their Lord, to the Path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy— 2. Allah,\nto Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth.\nAnd woe to the disbelievers because of a severe torment! 3. ˹They are˺ the\nones who favour the life of this world over the Hereafter and hinder ˹others˺\nfrom the Way of Allah, striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked. It is they who\nhave gone far astray.\nDelivering the Message\n4. We have not sent a messenger except in the language of his people to\nclarify ˹the message˺ for them. Then Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray\nand guides whoever He wills. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.\nProphet Moses\n5. Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs, ˹ordering him,˺ “Lead your\npeople out of darkness and into light, and remind them of Allah’s days ˹of\nfavour˺.” Surely in this are signs for whoever is steadfast, grateful. 6.\n˹Consider˺ when Moses said to his people, “Remember Allah’s favour upon\nyou when He rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you\nwith dreadful torment—slaughtering your sons and keeping your women.\n\n-- 225 of 694 --\n\nThat was a severe test from your Lord. 7. And ˹remember˺ when your Lord\nproclaimed, ‘If you are grateful, I will certainly give you more. But if you\nare ungrateful, surely My punishment is severe.’” 8. Moses added, “If you\nalong with everyone on earth were to be ungrateful, then ˹know that˺ Allah\nis indeed Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.”\nWarning to the Pagans of Mecca\n9. Have you not ˹already˺ received the stories of those who were before\nyou: the people of Noah, ’Âd, Thamûd, and those after them? Only Allah\nknows how many they were. Their messengers came to them with clear\nproofs, but they put their hands over their mouths[477] and said, “We totally\nreject what you have been sent with, and we are certainly in alarming doubt\nabout what you are inviting us to.”\nDisbelievers’ Arguments\n10. Their messengers asked ˹them˺, “Is there any doubt about Allah, the\nOriginator of the heavens and the earth? He is inviting you in order to\nforgive your sins, and delay your end until your appointed term.”[478] They\nargued, “You are no more than humans like us! You ˹only˺ wish to turn us\naway from what our forefathers worshipped. So bring us some compelling\nproof.” 11. Their messengers said to them, “We are ˹indeed˺ only humans\nlike you, but Allah favours whoever He chooses of His servants. It is not for\nus to bring you any proof without Allah’s permission. And in Allah let the\nbelievers put their trust. 12. Why should we not put our trust in Allah, when\nHe has truly guided us to ˹the very best of˺ ways? Indeed, we will patiently\nendure whatever harm you may cause us. And in Allah let the faithful put\ntheir trust.”\nDisbelievers’ Fate\n13. The disbelievers then threatened their messengers, “We will certainly\nexpel you from our land, unless you return to our faith.” So their Lord\nrevealed to them, “We will surely destroy the wrongdoers, 14. and make\nyou reside in the land after them. This is for whoever is in awe of standing\nbefore Me and fears My warning.” 15. And both sides called for judgment,\nso every stubborn tyrant was doomed. 16. Awaiting them is Hell, and they\nwill be left to drink oozing pus, 17. which they will sip with difficulty, and\n\n-- 226 of 694 --\n\ncan hardly swallow. Death will overwhelm them from every side, yet they\nwill not ˹be able to˺ die. Awaiting them still is harsher torment.\nWasted Deeds\n18. The parable of the deeds of those who disbelieve in their Lord is that of\nashes fiercely blown away by wind on a stormy day. They will gain nothing\nfrom what they have earned. That is ˹truly˺ the farthest one can stray.\nA Reminder to Humanity\n19. Have you not seen that Allah created the heavens and the earth for a\nreason? If He wills, He can eliminate you and produce a new creation. 20.\nAnd that is not difficult for Allah ˹at all˺.\nDisbelievers Disowning Each Other\n21. They will all appear before Allah, and the lowly ˹followers˺ will appeal\nto the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “We were your ˹dedicated˺ followers, so will you\n˹then˺ protect us from Allah’s torment in any way?” They will reply, “Had\nAllah guided us, we would have guided you. ˹Now˺ it is all the same for us\nwhether we suffer patiently or impatiently, there is no escape for us.”\nSatan’s Talk[479]\n22. And Satan will say ˹to his followers˺ after the judgment has been\npassed, “Indeed, Allah has made you a true promise. I too made you a\npromise, but I failed you. I did not have any authority over you. I only\ncalled you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame\nyourselves. I cannot save you, nor can you save me. Indeed, I denounce\nyour previous association of me with Allah ˹in loyalty˺. Surely the\nwrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.”\nReward of the Believers\n23. Those who believe and do good will be admitted into Gardens, under\nwhich rivers flow—to stay there forever by the Will of their Lord—where\nthey will be greeted with “Peace!”\nParable of Good and Evil Words\n24. Do you not see how Allah compares a good word to a good tree? Its\nroot is firm and its branches reach the sky, 25. ˹always˺ yielding its fruit in\nevery season by the Will of its Lord. This is how Allah sets forth parables\nfor the people, so perhaps they will be mindful. 26. And the parable of an\nevil word is that of an evil tree, uprooted from the earth, having no stability.\n\n-- 227 of 694 --\n\nThe Firm Word\n27. Allah makes the believers steadfast with the firm Word ˹of faith˺[480] in\nthis worldly life and the Hereafter. And Allah leaves the wrongdoers to\nstray. For Allah does what He wills.\nReward of the Ungrateful\n28. Have you not seen those ˹disbelievers˺ who meet Allah’s favours with\ningratitude and lead their own people to their doom? 29. In Hell they will\nburn. What an evil place for settlement. 30. They set up equals to Allah to\nmislead ˹others˺ from His Way. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Enjoy yourselves! Surely\nyour destination is the Fire.”\nOrder to the Prophet\n31. Tell My believing servants to establish prayer and donate from what We\nhave provided for them—openly and secretly—before the arrival of a Day\nin which there will be no ransom or friendly connections.\nAllah’s Favours\n32. It is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and sends down rain\nfrom the sky, causing fruits to grow as a provision for you. He has subjected\nthe ships for your service, sailing through the sea by His command, and has\nsubjected the rivers for you. 33. He has ˹also˺ subjected for you the sun and\nthe moon, both constantly orbiting, and has subjected the day and night for\nyou. 34. And He has granted you all that you asked Him for. If you tried to\ncount Allah’s blessings, you would never be able to number them. Indeed\nhumankind is truly unfair, ˹totally˺ ungrateful.[481]\nAbraham’s Prayers\n35. ˹Remember˺ when Abraham prayed, “My Lord! Make this city ˹of\nMecca˺ secure, and keep me and my children away from the worship of\nidols. 36. My Lord! They have caused many people to go astray. So\nwhoever follows me is with me, and whoever disobeys me—then surely\nYou are ˹still˺ All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 37. Our Lord! I have settled\nsome of my offspring in a barren valley, near Your Sacred House, our Lord,\nso that they may establish prayer. So make the hearts of ˹believing˺ people\nincline towards them and provide them with fruits, so perhaps they will be\nthankful. 38. Our Lord! You certainly know what we conceal and what we\nreveal. Nothing on earth or in heaven is hidden from Allah. 39. All praise is\n\n-- 228 of 694 --\n\nfor Allah who has blessed me with Ishmael and Isaac in my old age. My\nLord is indeed the Hearer of ˹all˺ prayers. 40. My Lord! Make me and those\n˹believers˺ of my descendants keep up prayer. Our Lord! Accept my\nprayers. 41. Our Lord! Forgive me, my parents, and the believers on the\nDay when the judgment will come to pass.”\nWarning to the Wicked\n42. Do not think ˹O Prophet˺ that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers\ndo. He only delays them until a Day when ˹their˺ eyes will stare in horror—\n43. rushing forth, heads raised, never blinking, hearts void. 44. And warn\nthe people of the Day when the punishment will overtake ˹the wicked\namong˺ them, and the wrongdoers will cry, “Our Lord! Delay us for a little\nwhile. We will respond to Your call and follow the messengers!” ˹It will be\nsaid,˺ “Did you not swear before that you would never be removed ˹to the\nnext life˺?” 45. You passed by the ruins of those ˹destroyed peoples˺ who\nhad wronged themselves.[482] It was made clear to you how We dealt with\nthem, and We gave you ˹many˺ examples. 46. They devised every plot,\nwhich was fully known to Allah, but their plotting was not enough to ˹even˺\noverpower mountains ˹let alone Allah˺.\nReward of the Wicked\n47. So do not think ˹O Prophet˺ that Allah will fail to keep His promise to\nHis messengers. Allah is indeed Almighty, capable of punishment. 48.\n˹Watch for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the earth will be changed into a different earth\nand the heavens as well, and all will appear before Allah—the One, the\nSupreme. 49. On that Day you will see the wicked bound together in chains,\n50. with garments of tar, and their faces covered with flames. 51. As such,\nAllah will reward every soul for what it has committed. Surely Allah is\nswift in reckoning.\nA Universal Message\n52. This ˹Quran˺ is a ˹sufficient˺ message for humanity so that they may\ntake it as a warning and know that there is only One God, and so that people\nof reason may be mindful.\n***\n\n-- 229 of 694 --\n\n15. The Stone Valley\n(Al-\nḤijr)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the place mentioned in 80-84, where\nthe people of\nṢâli\nḥ once lived. Other destroyed peoples are mentioned as a\nwarning to the Arab deniers, who are also warned at the beginning of the\nnext sûrah. Satan’s arrogance towards Allah and enmity towards humanity\nare emphasized. The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is urged to exercise patience and\nseek comfort in worship.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n1. Alif-Lãm-Ra. These are the verses of the Book; the clear Quran. 2. ˹The\nday will come when˺ the disbelievers will certainly wish they had submitted\n˹to Allah˺.[483] 3. ˹So˺ let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by\n˹false˺ hope, for they will soon know. 4. We have never destroyed a society\nwithout a destined term. 5. No people can advance their doom, nor can they\ndelay it.\nThe Pagans Mocking the Prophet\n6. They say, “O you to whom the Reminder[484] is revealed! You must be\ninsane! 7. Why do you not bring us the angels, if what you say is true?” 8.\nWe do not send the angels down except for a just cause, and then ˹the end\nof˺ the disbelievers will not be delayed. 9. It is certainly We Who have\nrevealed the Reminder, and it is certainly We Who will preserve it.\nCommitted to Disbelief\n10. Indeed, We sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ among the groups\nof early peoples, 11. but no messenger ever came to them without being\nmocked. 12. This is how We allow disbelief ˹to steep˺ into the hearts of the\nwicked. 13. They would not believe in this ˹Quran˺ despite the ˹many˺\nexamples of those ˹destroyed˺ before. 14. And even if We opened for them a\ngate to heaven, through which they continued to ascend, 15. still they would\nsay, “Our eyes have truly been dazzled! In fact, we must have been\nbewitched.”\n\n-- 230 of 694 --\n\nDivine Power\n16. Indeed, We have placed constellations in the sky, and adorned it for all\nto see. 17. And We protected it from every accursed devil, 18. except the\none eavesdropping, who is then pursued by a visible flare.[485] 19. As for\nthe earth, We spread it out and placed upon it firm mountains, and caused\neverything to grow there in perfect balance. 20. And We made in it means\nof sustenance for you and others, who you do not provide for. 21. There is\nnot any means ˹of sustenance˺ whose reserves We do not hold, only\nbringing it forth in precise measure. 22. We send fertilizing winds, and\nbring down rain from the sky for you to drink. It is not you who hold its\nreserves. 23. Surely it is We Who give life and cause death. And We are the\n˹Eternal˺ Successor.[486] 24. We certainly know those who have gone before\nyou and those who will come after ˹you˺. 25. Surely your Lord ˹alone˺ will\ngather them together ˹for judgment˺. He is truly All-Wise, All-Knowing.\nCreation of Adam\n26. Indeed, We created man from sounding clay moulded from black mud.\n27. As for the jinn, We created them earlier from smokeless fire. 28.\n˹Remember, O Prophet˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to\ncreate a human being from sounding clay moulded from black mud.[487] 29.\nSo when I have fashioned him and had a spirit of My Own ˹creation˺\nbreathed into him, fall down in prostration to him.”\nSatan’s Defiance\n30. So the angels prostrated all together— 31. but not Iblîs,[488] who refused\nto prostrate with the others. 32. Allah asked, “O Iblîs! What is the matter\nwith you that you did not join others in prostration?” 33. He replied, “It is\nnot for me to prostrate to a human You created from sounding clay moulded\nfrom black mud.” 34. Allah commanded, “Then get out of Paradise, for you\nare truly cursed. 35. And surely upon you is condemnation until the Day of\nJudgment.”\nSatan’s Appeal\n36. Satan appealed, “My Lord! Then delay my end until the Day of their\nresurrection.” 37. Allah said, “You will be delayed 38. until the appointed\nDay.” 39. Satan responded, “My Lord! For allowing me to stray I will\nsurely tempt them on earth and mislead them all together, 40. except Your\n\n-- 231 of 694 --\n\nchosen servants among them.” 41. Allah said, “This is the Way, binding on\nMe: 42. you will certainly have no authority over My servants, except the\ndeviant who follow you, 43. and surely Hell is their destined place, all\ntogether. 44. It has seven gates, to each a group of them is designated.”\nThe Righteous in Paradise\n45. Indeed, the righteous will be amid Gardens and springs. 46. ˹It will be\nsaid to them,˺ “Enter in peace and security.” 47. We will remove whatever\nbitterness they had in their hearts.[489] In a friendly manner, they will be on\nthrones, facing one another. 48. No fatigue will touch them there, nor will\nthey ever be asked to leave.\nAllah’s Grace and Torment\n49. Inform My servants ˹O Prophet˺ that I am truly the All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful, 50. and that My torment is indeed the most painful.\nAbraham Visited by Angels\n51. And inform them ˹O Prophet˺ about Abraham’s guests 52. who entered\nupon him and greeted ˹him with˺, “Peace!” He ˹later˺ said, “Surely we are\nafraid of you.”[490] 53. They reassured ˹him˺, “Do not be afraid! Surely we\ngive you good news of a knowledgeable son.” 54. He wondered, “Do you\ngive me good news despite my old age? What unlikely news!” 55. They\nresponded, “We give you good news in all truth, so do not be one of those\nwho despair.” 56. He exclaimed, “Who would despair of the mercy of their\nLord except the misguided?” 57. He ˹then˺ added, “What is your mission, O\nmessenger-angels?” 58. They replied, “We have actually been sent to a\nwicked people. 59. As for the family of Lot, we will certainly deliver them\nall, 60. except his wife. We have determined that she will be one of the\ndoomed.”\nLot Visited by Angels\n61. So when the messengers came to the family of Lot, 62. he said, “You\nare surely an unfamiliar people!” 63. They responded, “We have come to\nyou with that ˹torment˺ which they have doubted. 64. We come to you with\nthe truth, and we are certainly truthful. 65. So travel with your family in the\ndark of night, and follow ˹closely˺ behind them. Do not let any of you look\nback, and go where you are commanded.” 66. We revealed to him this\ndecree: “Those ˹sinners˺ will be uprooted in the morning.”\n\n-- 232 of 694 --\n\nDestruction of the People of Lot\n67. And there came the men of the city, rejoicing. 68. Lot pleaded, “Indeed,\nthese are my guests, so do not embarrass me. 69. Fear Allah and do not\nhumiliate me.” 70. They responded, “Have we not forbidden you from\nprotecting anyone?” 71. He said, “O my people! Here are my daughters[491]\n˹so marry them˺ if you wish to do so.” 72. By your life ˹O Prophet˺,[492]\nthey certainly wandered blindly, intoxicated ˹by lust˺. 73. So the ˹mighty˺\nblast overtook them at sunrise. 74. And We turned the cities ˹of Sodom and\nGomorrah˺ upside down and rained upon them stones of baked clay. 75.\nSurely in this are signs for those who contemplate. 76. Their ruins still lie\nalong a known route. 77. Surely in this is a sign for those who believe.\nThe People of Shu’aib\n78. And the residents of the Forest were truly wrongdoers, 79. so We\ninflicted punishment upon them. The ruins of both nations still lie on a\nwell-known road.\nThe People of\nṢâli\nḥ\n80. Indeed, the residents of the Stone Valley also denied the messengers.\n[493] 81. We gave them Our signs, but they turned away from them. 82.\nThey carved their homes in the mountains, feeling secure. 83. But the\n˹mighty˺ blast overtook them in the morning, 84. and all they achieved was\nof no help to them.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n85. We have not created the heavens and the earth and everything in\nbetween except for a purpose. And the Hour is certain to come, so forgive\ngraciously. 86. Surely your Lord is the Master Creator, All-Knowing. 87.\nWe have certainly granted you the seven often-repeated verses[494] and the\ngreat Quran. 88. Do not let your eyes crave the ˹fleeting˺ pleasures We have\nprovided for some of the disbelievers, nor grieve for them. And be gracious\nto the believers.\nMore Advice to the Prophet\n89. And say, “I am truly sent with a clear warning”— 90. ˹a warning˺\nsimilar to what We sent to those who divided ˹the Scriptures˺, 91. who\n˹now˺ accept parts of the Quran, rejecting others. 92. So by your Lord! We\nwill certainly question them all 93. about what they used to do. 94. So\n\n-- 233 of 694 --\n\nproclaim what you have been commanded, and turn away from the\npolytheists. 95. Surely We will be sufficient for you against the mockers,\n96. who set up ˹other˺ gods with Allah. They will soon come to know.\nAllah Is the Refuge\n97. We certainly know that your heart is truly distressed by what they say.\n98. So glorify the praises of your Lord and be one of those who ˹always˺\npray, 99. and worship your Lord until the inevitable[495] comes your way.\n***\n\n-- 234 of 694 --\n\n16. Bees\n(An-Na\nḥl)\nThis Meccan sûrah, also known as the Chapter of Blessings (Sûratu An-\nNi’am), takes its name from the bees mentioned in verses 68-69, which are\ndescribed as one of Allah’s numerous favours to humanity. Instead of\nshowing gratitude to Allah for all these blessings, the pagans wilfully set up\nidols, associating them with Allah in worship. They are also condemned for\nburying their daughters alive (verses 58-59). References are made to\ngrateful believers and ungrateful disbelievers along with the ultimate\nreward for each group. Abraham (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is cited close to the end of the\nsûrah as a grateful servant of Allah, whose example should be emulated by\nall believers. The sûrah concludes by instructing the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to\nendure patiently and invite all to the Way of Allah with wisdom and grace.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWarning of Judgment\n1. The command of Allah is at hand, so do not hasten it. Glorified and\nExalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him in worship˺!\nAllah’s Favours: 1) Divine Guidance\n2. He sends down the angels with revelation by His command to whoever\nHe wills of His servants, ˹stating:˺ “Warn ˹humanity˺ that there is no god\n˹worthy of worship˺ except Me, so be mindful of Me ˹alone˺.”\nFavour 2) The Heavens and Earth\n3. He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. Exalted is He above\nwhat they associate with Him ˹in worship˺!\nFavour 3) Creation of Humans\n4. He created humans from a sperm-drop, then—behold!—they openly\nchallenge ˹Him˺.\nFavour 4) Animals\n5. And He created the cattle for you as a source of warmth, food, and ˹many\nother˺ benefits. 6. They are also pleasing to you when you bring them home\nand when you take them out to graze. 7. And they carry your loads to\n\n-- 235 of 694 --\n\n˹distant˺ lands which you could not otherwise reach without great hardship.\nSurely your Lord is Ever Gracious, Most Merciful. 8. ˹He also created˺\nhorses, mules, and donkeys for your transportation and adornment. And He\ncreates what you do not know.\nFavour 5) The Way of Islam\n9. It is upon Allah ˹alone˺ to ˹clearly˺ show the Straight Way. Other ways\nare deviant. Had He willed, He would have easily imposed guidance upon\nall of you.\nFavour 6) Water\n10. He is the One Who sends down rain from the sky, from which you drink\nand by which plants grow for your cattle to graze. 11. With it He produces\nfor you ˹various˺ crops, olives, palm trees, grapevines, and every type of\nfruit. Surely in this is a sign for those who reflect.\nFavour 7) Celestial Events\n12. And He has subjected for your benefit the day and the night, the sun and\nthe moon. And the stars have been subjected by His command. Surely in\nthis are signs for those who understand.\nFavour 8) Other Creation\n13. And ˹He subjected˺ for you whatever He has created on earth of varying\ncolours.[496] Surely in this is a sign for those who are mindful.\nFavour 9) Seas\n14. And He is the One Who has subjected the sea, so from it you may eat\ntender seafood and extract ornaments to wear. And you see the ships\nploughing their way through it, so you may seek His bounty and give\nthanks ˹to Him˺.\nFavour 10) Natural Marvels\n15. He has placed into the earth firm mountains, so it does not shake with\nyou, as well as rivers, and pathways so you may find your way. 16. Also by\nlandmarks and stars do people find their way.\nAlmighty Allah or Powerless Gods?\n17. Can the One Who creates be equal to those who do not? Will you not\nthen be mindful? 18. If you tried to count Allah’s blessings, you would\nnever be able to number them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most\n\n-- 236 of 694 --\n\nMerciful. 19. And Allah knows what you conceal and what you reveal. 20.\nBut those ˹idols˺ they invoke besides Allah cannot create anything—they\nthemselves are created. 21. They are dead, not alive—not even knowing\nwhen their followers will be resurrected. 22. Your God is ˹only˺ One God.\nAs for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are in denial,\nand they are too proud. 23. Without a doubt, Allah knows what they conceal\nand what they reveal. He certainly does not like those who are too proud.\nReward of the Wicked\n24. And when it is said to them, “What has your Lord revealed?” They say,\n“Ancient fables!” 25. Let them bear their burdens in full on the Day of\nJudgment as well as some of the burdens of those they mislead without\nknowledge. Evil indeed is what they will bear! 26. Indeed, those before\nthem had plotted, but Allah struck at the ˹very˺ foundation of their structure,\nso the roof collapsed on top of them, and the torment came upon them from\nwhere they did not expect.[497] 27. Then on the Day of Judgment He will\nhumiliate them and say, “Where are My ˹so-called˺ associate-gods for\nwhose sake you used to oppose ˹the believers˺?” Those gifted with\nknowledge will say, “Surely disgrace and misery today are upon the\ndisbelievers.” 28. Those whose souls the angels seize while they wrong\nthemselves will then offer ˹full˺ submission ˹and say falsely,˺ “We did not\ndo any evil.” ˹The angels will say,˺ “No! Surely Allah fully knows what you\nused to do. 29. So enter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever. Indeed, what\nan evil home for the arrogant!”\nReward of the Righteous\n30. And ˹when˺ it is said to those mindful ˹of Allah˺, “What has your Lord\nrevealed?” They say, “All the best!” For those who do good in this world,\nthere is goodness. But far better is the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter. How\nexcellent indeed is the home of the righteous: 31. the Gardens of Eternity\nwhich they will enter, under which rivers flow. In it they will have whatever\nthey desire. This is how Allah rewards the righteous— 32. those whose\nsouls the angels take while they are virtuous, saying ˹to them˺, “Peace be\nupon you! Enter Paradise for what you used to do.”\nWarning to Pagan Deniers\n33. Are they only awaiting the coming of the angels or the command of\nyour Lord ˹O Prophet˺? So were those before them. And Allah never\n\n-- 237 of 694 --\n\nwronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves. 34. Then the evil\n˹consequences˺ of their deeds overtook them, and they were overwhelmed\nby what they used to ridicule.\nFalse Argument\n35. The polytheists argue, “Had Allah willed, neither we nor our forefathers\nwould have worshipped anything other than Him, nor prohibited anything\nwithout His command.” So did those before them. Is not the messengers’\nduty only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly?\nSame Fate\n36. We surely sent a messenger to every community, saying, “Worship\nAllah and shun false gods.” But some of them were guided by Allah, while\nothers were destined to stray. So travel throughout the land and see the fate\nof the deniers! 37. Even though you ˹O Prophet˺ are keen on their guidance,\nAllah certainly does not guide those He leaves to stray, and they will have\nno helpers.\nThe Resurrection\n38. They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that Allah will never raise\nthe dead to life. Yes ˹He will˺! It is a true promise binding on Him, but most\npeople do not know. 39. ˹He will do that˺ to make clear to them what they\ndisagreed on, and for the disbelievers to know that they were liars. 40. If\nWe ever will something ˹to exist˺, all We say is: “Be!” And it is!\nReward of the Steadfast\n41. As for those who emigrated in ˹the cause of˺ Allah after being\npersecuted, We will surely bless them with a good home in this world. But\nthe reward of the Hereafter is far better, if only they knew. 42. ˹It is˺ they\nwho have patiently endured, and in their Lord they put their trust.\nMessengers Are Not Angels\n43. We did not send ˹messengers˺ before you ˹O Prophet˺ except mere men\ninspired by Us. If you ˹polytheists˺ do not know ˹this already˺, then ask\nthose who have knowledge ˹of the Scriptures˺. 44. ˹We sent them˺ with clear\nproofs and divine Books. And We have sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ the\nReminder, so that you may explain to people what has been revealed for\nthem, and perhaps they will reflect.\nWarning to the Wicked\n\n-- 238 of 694 --\n\n45. Do those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not cause the\nearth to swallow them? Or that the torment will not come upon them in\nways they cannot comprehend? 46. Or that He will not seize them while\nthey go about ˹their day˺, for then they will have no escape? 47. Or that He\nwill not destroy them gradually? But your Lord is truly Ever Gracious,\nMost Merciful.\nEverything Submits to Allah\n48. Have they not considered how the shadows of everything Allah has\ncreated incline to the right and the left ˹as the sun moves˺, totally submitting\nto Allah in all humility? 49. And to Allah ˹alone˺ bows down ˹in\nsubmission˺[498] whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of\nliving creatures, as do the angels—who are not too proud ˹to do so˺. 50.\nThey[499] fear their Lord above them, and do whatever they are\ncommanded.\nOne God Alone\n51. And Allah has said, “Do not take two gods. There is only One God. So\nbe in awe of Me ˹alone˺.” 52. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens\nand the earth, and to Him ˹alone˺ is the everlasting devotion. Will you then\nfear any other than Allah?\nIngratitude to Allah\n53. Whatever blessings you have are from Allah. Then whenever hardship\ntouches you, to Him ˹alone˺ you cry ˹for help˺. 54. Then as soon as He\nremoves the hardship from you, a group of you associates ˹others˺ with their\nLord ˹in worship˺, 55. only returning Our favours with ingratitude. So enjoy\nyourselves, for you will soon know.\nOfferings to Idols\n56. And they ˹even˺ assign to those ˹idols˺—who know nothing—a share of\nwhat We have provided for them. By Allah! You will certainly be\nquestioned about whatever ˹lies˺ you used to fabricate ˹against Allah˺.\nAllah’s Daughters?\n57. And they attribute ˹angels as˺ daughters to Allah—glory be to Him!—\nthe opposite of what they desire for themselves. 58. Whenever one of them\nis given the good news of a baby girl, his face grows gloomy, as he\nsuppresses his rage. 59. He hides himself from the people because of the\n\n-- 239 of 694 --\n\nbad news he has received. Should he keep her in disgrace, or bury her\n˹alive˺ in the ground? Evil indeed is their judgment![500] 60. To those who\ndisbelieve in the Hereafter belong all evil qualities, whereas to Allah belong\nthe finest attributes. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.\nFavour 11) Allowing Time for Repentance\n61. If Allah were to punish people ˹immediately˺ for their wrongdoing, He\nwould not have left a single living being on earth. But He delays them for\nan appointed term. And when their time arrives, they cannot delay it for a\nmoment, nor could they advance it.\nEmpty Hopes\n62. They attribute to Allah what they hate ˹for themselves˺,[501] and their\ntongues utter the lie that they will have the finest reward. Without a doubt,\nfor them is the Fire, where they will be abandoned.\nEvil Communities\n63. By Allah! We have surely sent messengers to communities before you\n˹O Prophet˺, but Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them. So he is\ntheir patron today, and they will suffer a painful punishment. 64. We have\nrevealed to you the Book only to clarify for them what they differed about,\nand as a guide and mercy for those who believe.\nFavour 12) Rain\n65. And Allah sends down rain from the sky, giving life to the earth after its\ndeath. Surely in this is a sign for those who listen.\nFavour 13) Cattle and Milk\n66. And there is certainly a lesson for you in cattle: We give you to drink of\nwhat is in their bellies, from between digested food and blood: pure milk,\npleasant to drink.[502] 67. And from the fruits of palm trees and grapevines\nyou derive intoxicants[503] as well as wholesome provision. Surely in this is\na sign for those who understand.\nFavour 14) Bees and Honey\n68. And your Lord inspired the bees: “Make ˹your˺ homes in the mountains,\nthe trees, and in what people construct, 69. and feed from ˹the flower of˺\nany fruit ˹you please˺ and follow the ways your Lord has made easy for\n\n-- 240 of 694 --\n\nyou.” From their bellies comes forth liquid of varying colours, in which\nthere is healing for people. Surely in this is a sign for those who reflect.\nAllah’s Power over Humans\n70. Allah has created you, and then causes you to die. And some of you are\nleft to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing\nafter having known much. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Capable.\nFavour 15) Provisions\n71. And Allah has favoured some of you over others in provision. But those\nwho have been much favoured would not share their wealth with those\n˹bondspeople˺ in their possession, making them their equals.[504] Do they\nthen deny Allah’s favours?\nFavour 16) Spouses and Offspring\n72. And Allah has made for you spouses of your own kind, and given you\nthrough your spouses children and grandchildren.[505] And He has granted\nyou good, lawful provisions. Are they then faithful to falsehood and\nungrateful for Allah’s favours?\nParables for Powerless Gods and Almighty Allah\n73. Yet they worship besides Allah those ˹idols˺ who do not afford them any\nprovision from the heavens and the earth, nor do they have the power to. 74.\nSo do not set up equals to Allah, for Allah certainly knows and you do not\nknow. 75. Allah sets forth a parable: a slave who lacks all means, compared\nto a ˹free˺ man to whom We granted a good provision, of which he donates\n˹freely,˺ openly and secretly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah. In fact,\nmost of them do not know. 76. And Allah sets forth a parable of two men:\none of them is dumb, incapable of anything. He is a burden on his master.\nWherever he is sent, he brings no good. Can such a person be equal to the\none who commands justice and is on the Straight Path?[506]\nAllah’s Knowledge and Might\n77. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs ˹the knowledge of˺ the unseen in the heavens\nand the earth. Bringing about the Hour would only take the blink of an eye,\nor even less. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.\nFavour 17) Senses\n78. And Allah brought you out of the wombs of your mothers while you\nknew nothing, and gave you hearing, sight, and intellect so perhaps you\n\n-- 241 of 694 --\n\nwould be thankful.\nFavour 18) Birds\n79. Have they not seen the birds glide in the open sky? None holds them up\nexcept Allah. Surely in this are signs for those who believe.\nFavour 19) Homes\n80. And Allah has made your homes a place to rest, and has given you tents\nfrom the hide of animals, light to handle when you travel and when you\ncamp. And out of their wool, fur, and hair He has given you furnishings and\ngoods for a while.\nFavour 20) Shelters\n81. And Allah has provided you shade out of what He created, and has\ngiven you shelter in the mountains. He has also provided you with clothes\nprotecting you from the heat ˹and cold˺, and armour shielding you in battle.\nThis is how He perfects His favour upon you, so perhaps you will ˹fully˺\nsubmit ˹to Him˺.\nDenying Allah’s Favours\n82. But if they turn away, then your duty ˹O Prophet˺ is only to deliver ˹the\nmessage˺ clearly. 83. They are aware of Allah’s favours, but still deny them.\nAnd most of them are ˹truly˺ ungrateful.\nFate of the Disbelievers\n84. ˹Consider, O Prophet,˺ the Day We will call ˹a prophet as˺ a witness\nfrom every faith-community. Then the disbelievers will neither be allowed\nto plead nor appease ˹their Lord˺. 85. And when the wrongdoers face the\npunishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor will they be delayed ˹from\nit˺. 86. And when the polytheists see their associate-gods, they will say,\n“Our Lord! These are our associate-gods that we used to invoke besides\nYou.” Their gods will throw a rebuttal at them, ˹saying,˺ “You are definitely\nliars.” 87. They will offer ˹full˺ submission to Allah on that Day, and\nwhatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them. 88. For those who disbelieve\nand hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, We will add more punishment to\ntheir punishment for all the corruption they spread.\nProphets Witness Against Disbelievers\n89. ˹Consider, O Prophet,˺ the Day We will call against every faith-\ncommunity a witness of their own. And We will call you to be a witness\n\n-- 242 of 694 --\n\nagainst these ˹people of yours˺. We have revealed to you the Book as an\nexplanation of all things, a guide, a mercy, and good news for those who\n˹fully˺ submit.\nAllah’s Commands and Prohibitions\n90. Indeed, Allah commands justice, grace, as well as courtesy to close\nrelatives. He forbids indecency, wickedness, and aggression. He instructs\nyou so perhaps you will be mindful.\nHonouring Pledges\n91. Honour Allah’s covenant when you make a pledge, and do not break\nyour oaths after confirming them, having made Allah your guarantor.\nSurely Allah knows all you do. 92. Do not be like the woman who\n˹foolishly˺ unravels her yarn after it is firmly spun, by taking your oaths as a\nmeans of deceiving one another in favour of a stronger group. Surely Allah\ntests you through this. And on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make\nyour differences clear to you.\nFavour 21) Free Choice\n93. Had Allah willed, He could have easily made you one community ˹of\nbelievers˺, but He leaves to stray whoever He wills and guides whoever He\nwills.[507] And you will certainly be questioned about what you used to do.\nHonouring Agreements\n94. And do not take your oaths as a means of deceiving one another or your\nfeet will slip after they have been firm. Then you will taste the evil\n˹consequences˺ of hindering ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, and you will\nsuffer a tremendous punishment. 95. And do not trade Allah’s covenant for\na fleeting gain. What is with Allah is certainly far better for you, if only you\nknew. 96. Whatever you have will end, but whatever Allah has is\neverlasting. And We will certainly reward the steadfast according to the best\nof their deeds.\nReward of the Good-Doers\n97. Whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, We will\nsurely bless them with a good life, and We will certainly reward them\naccording to the best of their deeds.\nAdvice to the Believers\n\n-- 243 of 694 --\n\n98. When you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the\naccursed. 99. He certainly has no authority over those who believe and put\ntheir trust in their Lord. 100. His authority is only over those who take him\nas a patron and who—under his influence—associate ˹others˺ with Allah ˹in\nworship˺.\nWho Is the Fabricator?\n101. When We replace a verse with another[508]—and Allah knows best\nwhat He reveals—they say, “You ˹Muḥammad˺ are just a fabricator.” In\nfact, most of them do not know. 102. Say, “The holy spirit[509] has brought\nit down from your Lord with the truth to reassure the believers, and as a\nguide and good news for those who submit ˹to Allah˺.” 103. And We surely\nknow that they say, “No one is teaching him except a human.” But the man\nthey refer to speaks a foreign tongue, whereas this ˹Quran˺ is ˹in˺ eloquent\nArabic.[510] 104. Surely those who do not believe in Allah’s revelations will\nnever be guided by Allah, and they will suffer a painful punishment. 105.\nNo one fabricates lies except those who disbelieve in Allah’s revelations,\nand it is they who are the ˹true˺ liars.\nAbandoning Faith\n106. Whoever disbelieves in Allah after their belief—not those who are\nforced while their hearts are firm in faith,[511] but those who embrace\ndisbelief wholeheartedly—they will be condemned by Allah and suffer a\ntremendous punishment. 107. This is because they prefer the life of this\nworld over the Hereafter. Surely Allah never guides those who ˹choose to˺\ndisbelieve. 108. They are the ones whose hearts, ears, and eyes are sealed\nby Allah, and it is they who are ˹truly˺ heedless. 109. Without a doubt, they\nwill be the losers in the Hereafter. 110. As for those who emigrated after\nbeing compelled ˹to renounce Islam˺, then struggled ˹in Allah’s cause˺, and\npersevered, your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful\nafter all.\nPay Day\n111. ˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ every soul will come pleading for itself, and\neach will be paid in full for what it did, and none will be wronged.\nThe Ungrateful People\n\n-- 244 of 694 --\n\n112. And Allah sets forth the example of a society which was safe and at\nease, receiving its provision in abundance from all directions. But its people\nmet Allah’s favours with ingratitude, so Allah made them taste the clutches\nof hunger and fear for their misdeeds. 113. A messenger of their own\nactually did come to them, but they denied him. So the torment overtook\nthem while they persisted in wrongdoing.\nLawful and Prohibited Foods\n114. So eat from the good, lawful things which Allah has provided for you,\nand be grateful for Allah’s favours, if you ˹truly˺ worship Him ˹alone˺. 115.\nHe has only forbidden you ˹to eat˺ carrion, blood, swine,[512] and what is\nslaughtered in the name of any other than Allah. But if someone is\ncompelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate\nneed—then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nWarning to the Polytheists\n116. Do not falsely declare with your tongues, “This is lawful, and that is\nunlawful,” ˹only˺ fabricating lies against Allah. Indeed, those who fabricate\nlies against Allah will never succeed. 117. ˹It is only˺ a brief enjoyment,\nthen they will suffer a painful punishment.\nProhibited Foods for Jews\n118. To the Jews, We have forbidden what We related to you before.[513] We\ndid not wrong them, but it was they who wronged themselves.\nAllah Accepts Repentance\n119. As for those who commit evil ignorantly ˹or recklessly˺, then repent\nafterwards and mend their ways, then your Lord is surely All-Forgiving,\nMost Merciful.\nProphet Abraham\n120. Indeed, Abraham was a model of excellence: devoted to Allah,\n˹perfectly˺ upright—not a polytheist— 121. ˹utterly˺ grateful for Allah’s\nfavours. ˹So˺ He chose him and guided him to the Straight Path. 122. We\nblessed him with all goodness in this world,[514] and in the Hereafter he will\ncertainly be among the righteous. 123. Then We revealed to you ˹O Prophet,\nsaying˺: “Follow the faith of Abraham, the upright, who was not one of the\npolytheists.” 124. ˹Honouring˺ the Sabbath was ordained only for those who\n\n-- 245 of 694 --\n\ndisputed about Abraham.[515] And surely your Lord will judge between\nthem on the Day of Judgment regarding their disputes.\nInviting to Islam\n125. Invite ˹all˺ to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and kind advice, and\nonly debate with them in the best manner. Surely your Lord ˹alone˺ knows\nbest who has strayed from His Way and who is ˹rightly˺ guided.\nGrace Is Best\n126. If you retaliate, then let it be equivalent to what you have suffered. But\nif you patiently endure, it is certainly best for those who are patient. 127. Be\npatient ˹O Prophet˺, for your patience is only with Allah’s help. Do not\ngrieve over those ˹who disbelieve˺, nor be distressed by their schemes. 128.\nSurely Allah is with those who shun evil and who do good ˹deeds˺.\n***\n\n-- 246 of 694 --\n\n17. The Night Journey\n(Al-Isrâ')\nSince Abraham (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is praised in the last verses of the previous sûrah\nas a role model for the world, this Meccan sûrah speaks of how the Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is honoured in this world through the Night Journey from Mecca\nto Jerusalem then to the heavens and back to Mecca—all in one night\n(verses 1 and 60). He (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) will also be honoured on the Day of\nJudgment through the station of praise where he will make intercession\n(verse 79). The children of Israel are referred to passingly at the end of the\nprevious sûrah, but more insights are given about them both at the\nbeginning and the end of this sûrah. The key to success in this life and\nsalvation in the next is encapsulated in a set of divine commandments\n(verses 22-39), along with a warning against Satan and his whispers\n(verses 61-65). The sûrah is critical of the pagan arguments against\nresurrection and their ridiculous demands (verses 89-93). Criticism of\nattributing partners and children to Allah is carried over to the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nJourney from Mecca to Jerusalem\n1. Glory be to the One Who took His servant ˹Muḥammad˺ by night from\nthe Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque whose surroundings We have\nblessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs.[516] Indeed, He[517]\nalone is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. 2. And We gave Moses the Scripture\nand made it a guide for the Children of Israel, ˹stating:˺ “Do not take\nbesides Me any other Trustee of Affairs, 3. ˹O˺ descendants of those We\ncarried with Noah ˹in the Ark˺! He was indeed a grateful servant.”\nWarning to the Israelites\n4. And We warned the Children of Israel in the Scripture, “You will\ncertainly cause corruption in the land twice, and you will become extremely\narrogant.\nThe Two Corruptions\n\n-- 247 of 694 --\n\n5. “When the first of the two warnings would come to pass, We would send\nagainst you some of Our servants of great might, who would ravage your\nhomes. This would be a warning fulfilled. 6. Then ˹after your repentance˺\nWe would give you the upper hand over them and aid you with wealth and\noffspring, causing you to outnumber them. 7. If you act rightly, it is for your\nown good, but if you do wrong, it is to your own loss. And when the second\nwarning would come to pass, your enemies would ˹be left to˺ totally\ndisgrace you and enter the Temple ˹of Jerusalem˺ as they entered it the first\ntime, and utterly destroy whatever would fall into their hands. 8. Perhaps\nyour Lord will have mercy on you ˹if you repent˺, but if you return ˹to sin˺,\nWe will return ˹to punishment˺. And We have made Hell a ˹permanent˺\nconfinement for the disbelievers.”\nThe Message of the Quran\n9. Surely this Quran guides to what is most upright, and gives good news to\nthe believers—who do good—that they will have a mighty reward. 10. And\n˹it warns˺ those who do not believe in the Hereafter ˹that˺ We have prepared\nfor them a painful punishment.\nPrayers in Anger\n11. And humans ˹swiftly˺ pray for evil[518] as they pray for good. For\nhumankind is ever hasty.\nThe Day and Night\n12. We made the day and night as two signs. So We made the sign of the\nnight devoid of light, and We made the sign of the day ˹perfectly˺ bright, so\nthat you may seek the bounty of your Lord and know the number of years\nand calculation ˹of time˺. And We have explained everything in detail.\nThe Record of Deeds\n13. We have bound every human’s destiny to their neck.[519] And on the\nDay of Judgment We will bring forth to each ˹person˺ a record which they\nwill find laid open. 14. ˹And it will be said,˺ “Read your record. You ˹alone˺\nare sufficient this Day to take account of yourself.” 15. Whoever chooses to\nbe guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is\nonly to their own loss. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of\nanother. And We would never punish ˹a people˺ until We have sent a\nmessenger ˹to warn them˺.\n\n-- 248 of 694 --\n\nPunishment of the Wicked\n16. Whenever We intend to destroy a society, We command its elite ˹to obey\nAllah˺ but they act rebelliously in it. So the decree ˹of punishment˺ is\njustified, and We destroy it utterly. 17. ˹Imagine˺ how many peoples We\nhave destroyed after Noah! And sufficient is your Lord as All-Aware and\nAll-Seeing of the sins of His servants.\nThis Life or the Next?\n18. Whoever desires this fleeting world ˹alone˺, We hasten in it whatever\nWe please to whoever We will; then We destine them for Hell, where they\nwill burn, condemned and rejected. 19. But whoever desires the Hereafter\nand strives for it accordingly, and is a ˹true˺ believer, it is they whose\nstriving will be appreciated. 20. We provide both the former and the latter\nfrom the bounty of your Lord. And the bounty of your Lord can never be\nwithheld. 21. See how We have favoured some over others ˹in this life˺, but\nthe Hereafter is certainly far greater in rank and in favour.\nCommandments: 1) Worship Allah Alone, 2) Honour Your Parents\n22. Do not set up any other god with Allah, or you will end up condemned,\nabandoned. 23. For your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him.\nAnd honour your parents. If one or both of them reach old age in your care,\nnever say to them ˹even˺ ‘ugh,’ nor yell at them. Rather, address them\nrespectfully. 24. And be humble with them out of mercy, and pray, “My\nLord! Be merciful to them as they raised me when I was young.” 25. Your\nLord knows best what is within yourselves. If you are righteous, He is\ncertainly All-Forgiving to those who ˹constantly˺ turn to Him.\n3) Give, 4) Do Not Waste\n26. Give to close relatives their due, as well as the poor and ˹needy˺\ntravellers. And do not spend wastefully. 27. Surely the wasteful are ˹like˺\nbrothers to the devils. And the Devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord. 28. But\nif you must turn them down ˹because you lack the means to give˺—while\nhoping to receive your Lord’s bounty—then ˹at least˺ give them a kind\nword.\n5) Spend Moderately\n29. Do not be so tight-fisted, for you will be blameworthy; nor so open-\nhanded, for you will end up in poverty. 30. Surely your Lord gives abundant\n\n-- 249 of 694 --\n\nor limited provisions to whoever He wills. He is certainly All-Aware, All-\nSeeing of His servants.\n6) Treasure Your Children\n31. Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and\nfor you. Surely killing them is a heinous sin.\n7) Do Not Commit Adultery\n32. Do not go near adultery. It is truly a shameful deed and an evil way.\n8) Do Not Kill\n33. Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺\nright.[520] If anyone is killed unjustly, We have given their heirs[521] the\nauthority, but do not let them exceed limits in retaliation,[522] for they are\nalready supported ˹by law˺.\n9) Protect Orphans’ Wealth, 10) Honour Pledges\n34. Do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless intending to\nenhance it—until they attain maturity. And honour ˹your˺ pledges, for you\nwill surely be accountable for them.\n11) Maintain Fairness\n35. Give in full when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is\nfairest and best in the end.\n12) Be Sure\n36. Do not follow what you have no ˹sure˺ knowledge of. Indeed, all will be\ncalled to account for ˹their˺ hearing, sight, and intellect.\n13) Be Humble\n37. And do not walk on the earth arrogantly. Surely you can neither crack\nthe earth nor stretch to the height of the mountains.\nCompliance with the Commandments\n38. The violation of any of these ˹commandments˺ is detestable to your\nLord. 39. This is part of the wisdom which your Lord has revealed to you\n˹O Prophet˺. And do not set up any other god with Allah ˹O humanity˺, or\nyou will be cast into Hell, blameworthy, rejected.\nRebuttal to a Pagan Claim\n40. Has your Lord favoured you ˹pagans˺ with sons and taken angels as\n˹His˺ daughters?[523] You are truly making an outrageous claim. 41. We\n\n-- 250 of 694 --\n\nhave surely varied ˹the signs˺ in this Quran so perhaps they may be mindful,\nbut it only drives them farther away.\nOther Gods?\n42. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Had there been other gods besides Him—as they\nclaim—then they would have certainly sought a way to ˹challenge˺ the Lord\nof the Throne.” 43. Glorified and Highly Exalted is He above what they\nclaim! 44. The seven heavens, the earth, and all those in them glorify Him.\nThere is not a single thing that does not glorify His praises—but you\n˹simply˺ cannot comprehend their glorification. He is indeed Most\nForbearing, All-Forgiving.\nThe Pagans Mock the Quran\n45. When you ˹O Prophet˺ recite the Quran, We put a hidden barrier\nbetween you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter. 46. We have\ncast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend it—and\ndeafness in their ears. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Quran,\nthey turn their backs in aversion. 47. We know best how they listen to your\nrecitation and what they say privately—when the wrongdoers say, “You\nwould only be following a bewitched man.” 48. See how they call you\nnames ˹O Prophet˺![524] So they have gone so ˹far˺ astray that they cannot\nfind the ˹Right˺ Way.\nThe Resurrection\n49. And they say ˹mockingly˺, “When we are reduced to bones and ashes,\nwill we really be raised as a new creation?” 50. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Yes,\neven if˺ you become stones, or iron, 51. or whatever you think is harder to\nbring to life!” Then they will ask ˹you˺, “Who will bring us back ˹to life˺?”\nSay, “The One Who created you the first time.” They will then shake their\nheads at you and ask, “When will that be?” Say, “Perhaps it is soon!” 52.\nOn the Day He will call you, you will ˹instantly˺ respond by praising Him,\n[525] thinking you had remained ˹in the world˺ only for a little while.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n53. Tell My ˹believing˺ servants to say only what is best. Satan certainly\nseeks to sow discord among them. Satan is indeed a sworn enemy to\nhumankind.\nInvitation to the Disbelievers\n\n-- 251 of 694 --\n\n54. Your Lord knows you best. He may have mercy on you if He wills, or\npunish you if He wills. We have not sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a keeper over\nthem. 55. Your Lord knows best all those in the heavens and the earth. And\nWe have surely favoured some prophets above others, and to David We\ngave the Psalms.[526]\nOther Gods Besides Allah?\n56. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Invoke those you claim ˹to be divine˺[527] besides\nHim—they do not have the power to undo harm from you or transfer it ˹to\nsomeone else˺.” 57. ˹Even˺ the closest ˹to Allah˺ of those invoked would be\nseeking a way to their Lord, hoping for His mercy, and fearing His\npunishment. Indeed, your Lord’s torment is fearsome.\nSigns Always Denied\n58. There is not a ˹wicked˺ society that We will not destroy or punish with a\nsevere torment before the Day of Judgment. That is written in the Record.\n59. Nothing keeps Us from sending the ˹demanded˺ signs except that they\nhad ˹already˺ been denied by earlier peoples. And We gave Thamûd the she-\ncamel as a clear sign, but they wrongfully rejected it.[528] We only send the\nsigns as a warning.\nSigns as a Test\n60. And ˹remember, O Prophet˺ when We told you, “Certainly your Lord\nencompasses the people.” And We have made what We brought you to\nsee[529] as well as the cursed tree ˹mentioned˺ in the Quran[530] only as a test\nfor the people. We keep warning them, but it only increases them greatly in\ndefiance.\nSatan’s Defiance\n61. And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,”\nso they all did—but not Iblîs,[531] who protested, “Should I prostrate to the\none You have created from mud?” 62. Adding, “Do you see this one you\nhonoured above me? If you delay my end until the Day of Judgment, I will\ncertainly take hold of his descendants, except for a few.” 63. Allah\nresponded, “Be gone! Whoever of them follows you, Hell will surely be the\nreward for all of you—an ample reward. 64. And incite whoever you can of\nthem with your voice, mobilize against them all your cavalry and infantry,\nmanipulate them in their wealth and children, and make them promises.”\n\n-- 252 of 694 --\n\nBut Satan promises them nothing but delusion. 65. ˹Allah added,˺ “You will\ntruly have no authority over My ˹faithful˺ servants.” And sufficient is your\nLord as a Guardian.\nHuman Ingratitude\n66. It is your Lord Who steers the ships for you through the sea, so that you\nmay seek His bounty. Surely He is ever Merciful to you. 67. When you are\ntouched with hardship at sea, you ˹totally˺ forget all ˹the gods˺ you\n˹normally˺ invoke, except Him. But when He delivers you ˹safely˺ to shore,\nyou turn away. Humankind is ever ungrateful.\nFalse Immunity\n68. Do you feel secure that He will not cause the land to swallow you up, or\nunleash upon you a storm of stones? Then you will find none to protect you.\n69. Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back to sea once again,\nand send upon you a violent storm, drowning you for your denial? Then\nyou will find none to avenge you against Us.\nAllah’s Favours to Humanity\n70. Indeed, We have dignified the children of Adam, carried them on land\nand sea, granted them good and lawful provisions, and privileged them far\nabove many of Our creatures.\nThe Record of Deeds\n71. ˹Beware of˺ the Day We will summon every people with their leader.\n[532] So whoever will be given their record in their right hand will read it\n˹happily˺ and will not be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date\nstone. 72. But whoever is blind ˹to the truth˺ in this ˹world˺ will be blind in\nthe Hereafter, and ˹even˺ far more astray from the ˹Right˺ Way.\nTemptation by Meccan Pagans\n73. They definitely ˹thought they˺ were about to lure you away from what\nWe have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺, hoping that you would attribute\nsomething else to Us falsely—and then they would have certainly taken you\nas a close friend.[533] 74. Had We not made you steadfast, you probably\nwould have inclined to them a little, 75. and then We truly would have\nmade you taste double ˹punishment˺ both in this life and after death, and\nyou would have found no helper against Us. 76. They were about to\nintimidate you to drive you out of the land ˹of Mecca˺, but then they would\n\n-- 253 of 694 --\n\nnot have survived after you ˹had left˺ except for a little while. 77. ˹This has\nbeen˺ Our way with the messengers We sent before you. And you will never\nfind any change in Our way.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n78. Observe the prayer from the decline of the sun until the darkness of the\nnight and the dawn prayer, for certainly the dawn prayer is witnessed ˹by\nangels˺.[534] 79. And rise at ˹the last˺ part of the night, offering additional\nprayers, so your Lord may raise you to a station of praise.[535] 80. And say,\n“My Lord! Grant me an honourable entrance and an honourable exit[536]\nand give me a supporting authority from Yourself.” 81. And declare, “The\ntruth has come and falsehood has vanished. Indeed, falsehood is bound to\nvanish.”\nThe Quran as a Healing\n82. We send down the Quran as a healing and mercy for the believers, but it\nonly increases the wrongdoers in loss.\nArrogance and Ingratitude\n83. When We grant people Our favours, they turn away, acting arrogantly.\nBut when touched with evil, they lose all hope. 84. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Everyone acts in their own way. But your Lord knows best whose way is\nrightly guided.”\nQuestion by Pagans\n85. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the spirit. Say, “Its nature is known\nonly to my Lord, and you ˹O humanity˺ have been given but little\nknowledge.”\nThe Quran as a Favour\n86. If We willed, We could have certainly taken away what We have\nrevealed to you ˹O Prophet˺—then you would find none to guarantee its\nreturn from Us— 87. had it not been for the mercy of your Lord. Indeed,\nHis favour upon you is immense.\nThe Quran Challenge\n88. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If ˹all˺ humans and jinn were to come together to\nproduce the equivalent of this Quran, they could not produce its equal, no\nmatter how they supported each other.”\n\n-- 254 of 694 --\n\nMeaningless Demands\n89. And We have truly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for humanity in this\nQuran, yet most people persist in disbelief. 90. They challenge ˹the\nProphet˺, “We will never believe in you until you cause a spring to gush\nforth from the earth for us, 91. or until you have a garden of palm trees and\nvineyards, and cause rivers to flow abundantly in it, 92. or cause the sky to\nfall upon us in pieces, as you have claimed, or bring Allah and the angels\nbefore us, face to face, 93. or until you have a house of gold, or you ascend\ninto heaven—and even then we will not believe in your ascension until you\nbring down to us a book that we can read.” Say, “Glory be to my Lord! Am\nI not only a human messenger?”\nAn Angelic Messenger?\n94. And nothing has prevented people from believing when guidance comes\nto them except their protest: “Has Allah sent a human as a messenger?” 95.\nSay, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Had there been angels walking the earth, well settled, We\nwould have surely sent down for them an angel from heaven as a\nmessenger.” 96. Say, “Sufficient is Allah as a Witness between me and you.\nHe is certainly All-Knowing, All-Seeing of His servants.”\nReward of the Wicked\n97. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray,\nyou will find no guardians for them besides Him. And We will drag them\non their faces on the Day of Judgment—deaf, dumb, and blind. Hell will be\ntheir home. Whenever it dies down, We will flare it up for them. 98. That is\ntheir reward for rejecting Our signs and asking ˹mockingly˺, “When we are\nreduced to bones and ashes, will we really be raised as a new creation?” 99.\nHave they not realized that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth,\ncan ˹easily˺ re-create them? He has ˹already˺ set for them a time, about\nwhich there is no doubt. But the wrongdoers persist in denial. 100. Say ˹to\nthem, O Prophet˺, “Even if you were to possess the ˹infinite˺ treasuries of\nmy Lord’s mercy, then you would certainly withhold ˹them˺, fearing they\nwould run out—for humankind is ever stingy!”\nPharaoh Challenges Moses\n101. We surely gave Moses nine clear signs.[537] ˹You, O Prophet, can˺ ask\nthe Children of Israel. When Moses came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “I\nreally think that you, O Moses, are bewitched.” 102. Moses replied, “You\n\n-- 255 of 694 --\n\nknow well that none has sent these ˹signs˺ down except the Lord of the\nheavens and the earth as insights. And I really think that you, O Pharaoh,\nare doomed.” 103. So Pharaoh wanted to scare the Israelites out of the land\n˹of Egypt˺, but We drowned him and all of those with him. 104. And We\nsaid to the Children of Israel after Pharaoh, “Reside in the land, but when\nthe promise of the Hereafter comes to pass,[538] We will bring you all\ntogether.”\nThe Noble Quran\n105. We have sent down the Quran in truth, and with the truth it has come\ndown. We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a deliverer of good news and a\nwarner. 106. ˹It is˺ a Quran We have revealed in stages so that you may\nrecite it to people at a deliberate pace. And We have sent it down in\nsuccessive revelations. 107. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Believe in this ˹Quran˺, or\ndo not. Indeed, when it is recited to those who were gifted with\nknowledge[539] before it ˹was revealed˺, they fall upon their faces in\nprostration, 108. and say, ‘Glory be to our Lord! Surely the promise of our\nLord has been fulfilled.’ 109. And they fall down upon their faces weeping,\nand it increases them in humility.”\nAdvice to the Prophet\n110. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most\nCompassionate—whichever you call, He has the Most Beautiful Names.”\nDo not recite your prayers too loudly or silently, but seek a way between.\n111. And say, “All praise is for Allah, Who has never had ˹any˺ offspring;\n[540] nor does He have a partner in ˹governing˺ the kingdom;[541] nor is He\npathetic, needing a protector.[542] And revere Him immensely.”\n***\n\n-- 256 of 694 --\n\n18. The Cave\n(Al-Kahf)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the story of the people of the cave in\nverses 9-26. According to Ibn ’Abbâs, the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was asked\nabout the youths who hid in a cave, a king who dominated large parts of the\nworld, and about the spirit, so 18:9-26, 18:83-99, and 17:85 were revealed.\nThe Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) says in an authentic narration collected by At-\nTirmi\nⱬi, “No one’s feet will move on Judgment Day until they are asked\nabout four things: 1) What they did in their youth. 2) How they earned and\nspent their wealth. 3) What they did with their knowledge. 4) And how they\nspent their lives.” Interestingly, these four questions correspond to the four\nstories mentioned in this sûrah: 1) The story of the youths and the cave. 2)\nThe story of the wealthy man with two gardens. 3) The story of Moses and\nthe man of knowledge. 4) And finally the story of\nⱫul-Qarnain and his life\nand travels in the service of Allah. The four stories are interjected by\nwarnings to the disbelievers and good news to the believers. Like the story\nof the people of the cave, some miraculous stories appear in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nMessage of the Quran\n1. All praise is for Allah Who has revealed the Book to His servant,[543]\nallowing no crookedness in it, 2. ˹making it˺ perfectly upright, to warn ˹the\ndisbelievers˺ of a severe torment from Him; to give good news to the\nbelievers—who do good—that they will have a fine reward, 3. in which\nthey will remain forever; 4. and to warn those who claim, “Allah has\noffspring.”[544] 5. They have no knowledge of this, nor did their forefathers.\nWhat a terrible claim that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but\nlies.\nBe Steadfast\n6. Now, perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their\ndenial, if they ˹continue to˺ disbelieve in this message. 7. We have indeed\nmade whatever is on earth as an adornment for it, in order to test which of\n\n-- 257 of 694 --\n\nthem is best in deeds. 8. And We will certainly reduce whatever is on it to\nbarren ground.\nStory 1) The People of the Cave\n9. Have you ˹O Prophet˺ thought that the people of the cave and the\nplaque[545] were ˹the only˺ wonders of Our signs? 10. ˹Remember˺ when\nthose youths took refuge in the cave, and said, “Our Lord! Grant us mercy\nfrom Yourself and guide us rightly through our ordeal.” 11. So We caused\nthem to fall into a dead sleep[546] in the cave for many years, 12. then We\nraised them so We may show which of the two groups would make a better\nestimation of the length of their stay.[547]\nStanding up for the Truth\n13. We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ their story in truth. They were youths who\ntruly believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance. 14. And\nWe strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is\nthe Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god\nbesides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.” 15. ˹Then\nthey said to one another,˺ “These people of ours have taken gods besides\nHim. Why do they not produce a clear proof of them? Who then does more\nwrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah? 16. Since you have\ndistanced yourselves from them and what they worship besides Allah, take\nrefuge in the cave. Your Lord will extend His mercy to you and\naccommodate you in your ordeal.”\nIn the Cave\n17. And you would have seen the sun, as it rose, inclining away from their\ncave to the right, and as it set, declining away from them to the left, while\nthey lay in its open space.[548] That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever\nAllah guides is truly guided. But whoever He leaves to stray, you will never\nfind for them a guiding mentor. 18. And you would have thought they were\nawake,[549] though they were asleep. We turned them over, to the right and\nleft, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. Had you looked\nat them, you would have certainly fled away from them, filled with horror.\nThe Youths Are Awakened\n19. And so We awakened them so that they might question one another.\nOne of them exclaimed, “How long have you remained ˹asleep˺?” Some\n\n-- 258 of 694 --\n\nreplied, “Perhaps a day, or part of a day.” They said ˹to one another˺, “Your\nLord knows best how long you have remained. So send one of you with\nthese silver coins of yours to the city, and let him find which food is the\npurest, and then bring you provisions from it. Let him be ˹exceptionally˺\ncautious, and do not let him give you away. 20. For, indeed, if they find out\nabout you, they will stone you ˹to death˺, or force you back into their faith,\nand then you will never succeed.”\nThe Hideout Is Found\n21. That is how We caused them to be discovered so that their people might\nknow that Allah’s promise ˹of resurrection˺ is true and that there is no doubt\nabout the Hour.[550] When the people disputed with each other about the\ncase of the youth ˹after their death˺,[551] some proposed, “Build a structure\naround them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in\nthe matter said, “We will surely build a place of worship over them.”\nHow Many Were They?\n22. Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others\nwill say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” ˹only˺ guessing blindly.\nAnd others will say, “They were seven and their dog was the eighth.” Say,\n˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord knows best their ˹exact˺ number. Only a few people\nknow as well.” So do not argue about them except with sure knowledge,\n[552] nor consult any of those ˹who debate˺ about them.\nSay, “Allah Willing”\n23. And never say of anything, “I will definitely do this tomorrow,” 24.\nwithout adding, “if Allah so wills!” But if you forget, then remember your\nLord, and say, “I trust my Lord will guide me to what is more right than\nthis.”\nTime Spent in the Cave\n25. They had remained in their cave for three hundred years, adding nine.\n[553] 26. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah knows best how long they stayed. With\nHim ˹alone˺ is ˹the knowledge of˺ the unseen of the heavens and the earth.\nHow perfectly He hears and sees! They have no guardian besides Him, and\nHe shares His command with none.”\nAdvice to the Prophet\n\n-- 259 of 694 --\n\n27. Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None\ncan change His Words, nor can you find any refuge besides Him. 28. And\npatiently stick with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening,\nseeking His pleasure.[554] Do not let your eyes look beyond them, desiring\nthe luxuries of this worldly life. And do not obey those whose hearts We\nhave made heedless of Our remembrance, who follow ˹only˺ their desires\nand whose state is ˹total˺ loss.\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n29. And say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹This is˺ the truth from your Lord. Whoever\nwills let them believe, and whoever wills let them disbelieve.” Surely We\nhave prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls will ˹completely˺\nsurround them. When they cry for aid, they will be aided with water like\nmolten metal, which will burn ˹their˺ faces. What a horrible drink! And\nwhat a terrible place to rest!\nReward of the Believers\n30. As for those who believe and do good, We certainly never deny the\nreward of those who are best in deeds. 31. It is they who will have the\nGardens of Eternity, with rivers flowing under their feet. There they will be\nadorned with bracelets of gold, and wear green garments of fine silk and\nrich brocade, reclining there on ˹canopied˺ couches. What a marvellous\nreward! And what a fabulous place to rest!\nStory 2) The Owner of the Two Gardens\n32. Give them ˹O Prophet˺ an example of two men. To ˹the disbelieving˺\none We gave two gardens of grapevines, which We surrounded with palm\ntrees and placed ˹various˺ crops in between. 33. Each garden yielded ˹all˺ its\nproduce, never falling short. And We caused a river to flow between them.\n34. And he had other resources[555] ˹as well˺. So he boasted to a ˹poor˺\ncompanion of his, while conversing with him, “I am greater than you in\nwealth and superior in manpower.” 35. And he entered his property, while\nwronging his soul, saying, “I do not think this will ever perish, 36. nor do I\nthink the Hour will ˹ever˺ come. And if in fact I am returned to my Lord, I\nwill definitely get a far better outcome than ˹all˺ this.”\nThe Rebuttal\n\n-- 260 of 694 --\n\n37. His ˹believing˺ companion replied, while conversing with him, “Do you\ndisbelieve in the One Who created you from dust,[556] then ˹developed you˺\nfrom a sperm-drop, then formed you into a man? 38. But as for me: He is\nAllah, my Lord, and I will never associate anyone with my Lord ˹in\nworship˺. 39. If only you had said, upon entering your property, ‘This is\nwhat Allah has willed! There is no power except with Allah!’ Even though\nyou see me inferior to you in wealth and offspring, 40. perhaps my Lord\nwill grant me ˹something˺ better than your garden, and send down upon\nyour garden a thunderbolt from the sky, turning it into a barren waste. 41.\nOr its water may sink ˹into the earth˺, and then you will never be able to\nseek it out.”\nThe Punishment\n42. And so all his produce was ˹totally˺ ruined, so he started to wring his\nhands for all he had spent on it, while it had collapsed on its trellises. He\ncried, “Alas! I wish I had never associated anyone with my Lord ˹in\nworship˺!” 43. And he had no manpower to help him against Allah, nor\ncould he ˹even˺ help himself. 44. At this time, support comes ˹only˺ from\nAllah—the True ˹Lord˺. He is best in reward and best in outcome.\nFleeting and Everlasting Gains\n45. And give them a parable of this worldly life. ˹It is˺ like the plants of the\nearth, thriving when sustained by the rain We send down from the sky. Then\nthey ˹soon˺ turn into chaff scattered by the wind. And Allah is fully capable\nof ˹doing˺ all things. 46. Wealth and children are the adornment of this\nworldly life, but the everlasting good deeds are far better with your Lord in\nreward and in hope.[557]\nJudgment Day\n47. ˹Beware of˺ the Day We will blow the mountains away, and you will see\nthe earth laid bare. And We will gather all ˹humankind˺, leaving none\nbehind. 48. They will be presented before your Lord in rows, ˹and the\ndeniers will be told,˺ “You have surely returned to Us ˹all alone˺ as We\ncreated you the first time, although you ˹always˺ claimed that We would\nnever appoint a time for your return.” 49. And the record ˹of deeds˺ will be\nlaid ˹open˺, and you will see the wicked in fear of what is ˹written˺ in it.\nThey will cry, “Woe to us! What kind of record is this that does not leave\n\n-- 261 of 694 --\n\nany sin, small or large, unlisted?” They will find whatever they did present\n˹before them˺. And your Lord will never wrong anyone.\nSatan and His Followers\n50. And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,”\nso they all did—but not Iblîs,[558] who was one of the jinn, but he rebelled\nagainst the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his\ndescendants as patrons instead of Me, although they are your enemy? What\nan evil alternative for the wrongdoers ˹to choose˺! 51. I never called them to\nwitness the creation of the heavens and the earth or ˹even˺ their own\ncreation, nor would I take the misleaders as helpers. 52. And ˹beware of˺ the\nDay He will say, “Call upon those you claimed were My associate-gods.”\nSo they will call them, but will receive no response. And We will make\nthem ˹all˺ share in the same doom. 53. The wicked will see the Fire and\nrealize that they are bound to fall into it, and will find no way to avoid it.\nDenying the Quran\n54. We have surely set forth in this Quran every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people,\nbut humankind is the most argumentative of all beings. 55. And nothing\nprevents people from believing when guidance comes to them and from\nseeking their Lord’s forgiveness except ˹their demand˺ to meet the same fate\nof earlier deniers or that the torment would confront them face to face. 56.\nWe do not send the messengers except as deliverers of good news and\nwarners. But the disbelievers argue in falsehood, ˹hoping˺ to discredit the\ntruth with it, and make a mockery of My revelations and warnings. 57. And\nwho does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord’s\nrevelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have\ndone? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable\nto comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears. And if you ˹O\nProphet˺ invite them to ˹true˺ guidance, they will never be ˹rightly˺ guided.\nAllah’s Forbearance\n58. Your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to seize them\n˹immediately˺ for what they commit, He would have certainly hastened\ntheir punishment. But they have an appointed time, from which they will\nfind no refuge. 59. Those ˹are the˺ societies We destroyed when they\npersisted in wrong,[559] and We had set a time for their destruction.\n\n-- 262 of 694 --\n\nStory 3) Moses and Al-Kha\nḍir\n60. And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his young assistant, “I will never\ngive up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I travel for\nages.”[560] 61. But when they ˹finally˺ reached the point where the seas met,\nthey forgot their ˹salted˺ fish, and it made its way into the sea, slipping\naway ˹wondrously˺. 62. When they had passed further, he said to his\nassistant, “Bring us our meal! We have certainly been exhausted by today’s\njourney.” 63. He replied, “Do you remember when we rested by the rock?\n˹That is when˺ I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention this except\nSatan. And the fish made its way into the sea miraculously.”[561] 64. Moses\nresponded, “That is ˹exactly˺ what we were looking for.”[562] So they\nreturned, retracing their footsteps.\nThe Encounter\n65. There they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had granted mercy\nfrom Us and enlightened with knowledge of Our Own. 66. Moses said to\nhim, “May I follow you, provided that you teach me some of the right\nguidance you have been taught?” 67. He said, “You certainly cannot be\npatient ˹enough˺ with me. 68. And how can you be patient with what is\nbeyond your ˹realm of˺ knowledge?” 69. Moses assured ˹him˺, “You will\nfind me patient, Allah willing, and I will not disobey any of your orders.”\n70. He responded, “Then if you follow me, do not question me about\nanything until I ˹myself˺ clarify it for you.”\nThe Ship Incident\n71. So they set out, but after they had boarded a ship, the man made a hole\nin it. Moses protested, “Have you done this to drown its people? You have\ncertainly done a terrible thing!” 72. He replied, “Did I not say that you\ncannot have patience with me?” 73. Moses pleaded, “Excuse me for\nforgetting, and do not be hard on me.”\nThe Boy Incident\n74. So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man killed him.\nMoses protested, “Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one?\nYou have certainly done a horrible thing.” 75. He answered, “Did I not tell\nyou that you cannot have patience with me?” 76. Moses replied, “If I ever\n\n-- 263 of 694 --\n\nquestion you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your\ncompany, for by then I would have given you enough of an excuse.”\nThe Wall Incident\n77. So they moved on until they came to the people of a town. They asked\nthem for food, but the people refused to give them hospitality. There they\nfound a wall ready to collapse, so the man set it right. Moses protested, “If\nyou wanted, you could have demanded a fee for this.” 78. He replied, “This\nis the parting of our ways. I will explain to you what you could not bear\npatiently.\nThe Ship\n79. “As for the ship, it belonged to some poor people, working at sea. So I\nintended to damage it, for there was a ˹tyrant˺ king ahead of them who\nseizes every ˹good˺ ship by force.\nThe Boy\n80. “And as for the boy, his parents were ˹true˺ believers, and we[563] feared\nthat he would pressure them into defiance and disbelief. 81. So we hoped\nthat their Lord would give them another, more virtuous and caring in his\nplace.\nThe Wall\n82. “And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and\nunder the wall was a treasure that belonged to them, and their father had\nbeen a righteous man. So your Lord willed that these children should come\nof age and retrieve their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it\n˹all˺ on my own. This is the explanation of what you could not bear\npatiently.”[564]\nStory 4)\nⱫul-Qarnain\n83. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about Ⱬul-Qarnain. Say, “I will relate to you\nsomething of his narrative.”[ 5 6 5 ] 84. Surely We established him in the land,\nand gave him the means to all things.\nJourney to the West\n85. So he travelled a course, 86. until he reached the setting ˹point˺ of the\nsun, which appeared to him to be setting in a spring of murky water, where\nhe found some people. We said, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Either punish them or\ntreat them kindly.” 87. He responded, “Whoever does wrong will be\n\n-- 264 of 694 --\n\npunished by us, then will be returned to their Lord, Who will punish them\nwith a horrible torment. 88. As for those who believe and do good, they will\nhave the finest reward, and we will assign them easy commands.”\nJourney to the East\n89. Then he travelled a ˹different˺ course 90. until he reached the rising\n˹point˺ of the sun. He found it rising on a people for whom We had provided\nno shelter from it.[566] 91. So it was. And We truly had full knowledge of\nhim.\nAnother Journey\n92. Then he travelled a ˹third˺ course 93. until he reached ˹a pass˺ between\ntwo mountains. He found in front of them a people who could hardly\nunderstand ˹his˺ language. 94. They pleaded, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Surely Gog\nand Magog[567] are spreading corruption throughout the land. Should we\npay you tribute, provided that you build a wall between us and them?” 95.\nHe responded, “What my Lord has provided for me is far better. But assist\nme with resources, and I will build a barrier between you and them. 96.\nBring me blocks of iron!” Then, when he had filled up ˹the gap˺ between\nthe two mountains, he ordered, “Blow!” When the iron became red hot, he\nsaid, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.” 97. And so the enemies\ncould neither scale nor tunnel through it. 98. He declared, “This is a mercy\nfrom my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will\nlevel it to the ground. And my Lord’s promise is ever true.” 99. On that\nDay, We will let them[568] surge ˹like waves˺ over one another. Later, the\nTrumpet will be blown,[569] and We will gather all ˹people˺ together.\nThe Wicked on Judgment Day\n100. On that Day We will display Hell clearly for the disbelievers, 101.\nthose who turned a blind eye to My Reminder[570] and could not stand\nlistening ˹to it˺. 102. Do the disbelievers think they can ˹simply˺ take My\nservants[571] as lords instead of Me? We have surely prepared Hell as an\naccommodation for the disbelievers.\nThe Losers\n103. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall we inform you of who will lose the most\ndeeds? 104. ˹They are˺ those whose efforts are in vain in this worldly life,\nwhile they think they are doing good!” 105. It is they who reject the signs\n\n-- 265 of 694 --\n\nof their Lord and their meeting with Him, rendering their deeds void, so We\nwill not give their deeds any weight on Judgment Day. 106. That is their\nreward: Hell, for their disbelief and mockery of My signs and messengers.\nThe Winners\n107. Indeed, those who believe and do good will have the Gardens of\nParadise[572] as an accommodation, 108. where they will be forever, never\ndesiring anywhere else.\nRecording Allah’s Knowledge\n109. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the ocean were ink for ˹writing˺ the Words of my\nLord, it would certainly run out before the Words of my Lord were finished,\neven if We refilled it with its equal.”\nHave Faith and Do Good\n110. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a man like you, ˹but˺ it has been revealed\nto me that your God is only One God. So whoever hopes for the meeting\nwith their Lord, let them do good deeds and associate none in the worship\nof their Lord.”\n***\n\n-- 266 of 694 --\n\n19. Mary\n(Mariam)\nThis Meccan sûrah recounts the miraculous stories of the birth of Jesus by\nthe virgin Mary (after whom the sûrah is named) and the birth of John the\nBaptist to old Zachariah and his elderly, barren wife. Other prophets are\ncited as recipients of Allah’s favour and grace. Attributing children to Allah\n(verses 88-95) and denial of resurrection (verses 66-70) are rejected as\noutrageous and blasphemous. Both the end of this sûrah and the beginning\nof the next one talk about the purpose of revealing the Quran.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nZachariah’s Prayer\n1. Kãf-Ha-Ya-’Aĩn-\nṢãd. 2. ˹This is˺ a reminder of your Lord’s mercy to His\nservant Zachariah, 3. when he cried out to his Lord privately, 4. saying,\n“My Lord! Surely my bones have become brittle, and grey hair has spread\nacross my head, but I have never been disappointed in my prayer to You,\nmy Lord! 5. And I am concerned about ˹the faith of˺ my relatives after me,\nsince my wife is barren. So grant me, by Your grace, an heir, 6. who will\ninherit ˹prophethood˺ from me and the family of Jacob, and make him, O\nLord, pleasing ˹to You˺!”\nPrayer Answered\n7. ˹The angels announced,˺ “O Zachariah! Indeed, We give you the good\nnews of ˹the birth of˺ a son, whose name will be John—a name We have not\ngiven to anyone before.” 8. He wondered, “My Lord! How can I have a son\nwhen my wife is barren, and I have become extremely old?” 9. An angel\nreplied, “So will it be! Your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me, just as I created\nyou before, when you were nothing!’” 10. Zachariah said, “My Lord! Grant\nme a sign.” He responded, “Your sign is that you will not ˹be able to˺ speak\nto people for three nights, despite being healthy.” 11. So he came out to his\npeople from the sanctuary, signalling to them to glorify ˹Allah˺ morning and\nevening.\nJohn’s Noble Qualities\n\n-- 267 of 694 --\n\n12. ˹It was later said,˺ “O John! Hold firmly to the Scriptures.” And We\ngranted him wisdom while ˹he was still˺ a child, 13. as well as purity and\ncompassion from Us. And he was God-fearing, 14. and kind to his parents.\nHe was neither arrogant nor disobedient. 15. Peace be upon him the day he\nwas born, and the day of his death, and the day he will be raised back to\nlife!\nGabriel Visits Mary\n16. And mention in the Book ˹O Prophet, the story of˺ Mary when she\nwithdrew from her family to a place in the east, 17. screening herself off\nfrom them. Then We sent to her Our angel, ˹Gabriel,˺ appearing before her\nas a man, perfectly formed. 18. She appealed, “I truly seek refuge in the\nMost Compassionate from you! ˹So leave me alone˺ if you are God-\nfearing.” 19. He responded, “I am only a messenger from your Lord, ˹sent˺\nto bless you with a pure son.” 20. She wondered, “How can I have a son\nwhen no man has ever touched me, nor am I unchaste?” 21. He replied, “So\nwill it be! Your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me. And so will We make him a\nsign for humanity and a mercy from Us.’ It is a matter ˹already˺ decreed.”\nJesus’ Virgin Birth\n22. So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place. 23.\nThen the pains of labour drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She cried,\n“Alas! I wish I had died before this, and was a thing long forgotten!” 24. So\na voice[573] reassured her from below her, “Do not grieve! Your Lord has\nprovided a stream at your feet. 25. And shake the trunk of this palm tree\ntowards you, it will drop fresh, ripe dates upon you. 26. So eat and drink,\nand put your heart at ease. But if you see any of the people, say, ‘I have\nvowed silence[574] to the Most Compassionate, so I am not talking to\nanyone today.’”\nReaction to Baby Jesus\n27. Then she returned to her people, carrying him. They said ˹in shock˺, “O\nMary! You have certainly done a horrible thing! 28. O sister of Aaron![575]\nYour father was not an indecent man, nor was your mother unchaste.” 29.\nSo she pointed to the baby. They exclaimed, “How can we talk to someone\nwho is an infant in the cradle?”\nBaby Jesus Talks\n\n-- 268 of 694 --\n\n30. Jesus declared, “I am truly a servant of Allah. He has destined me to be\ngiven the Scripture and to be a prophet. 31. He has made me a blessing\nwherever I go, and bid me to establish prayer and give alms-tax as long as I\nlive, 32. and to be kind to my mother. He has not made me arrogant or\ndefiant. 33. Peace be upon me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day\nI will be raised back to life!”\nChristians and Jews Differ on Jesus\n34. That is Jesus, son of Mary. ˹And this is˺ a word of truth, about which\nthey dispute. 35. It is not for Allah to take a son! Glory be to Him. When\nHe decrees a matter, He simply tells it, “Be!” And it is! 36. ˹Jesus also\ndeclared,˺ “Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him ˹alone˺.\nThis is the Straight Path.” 37. Yet their ˹various˺ groups have differed\namong themselves ˹about him˺, so woe to the disbelievers when they face a\ntremendous Day! 38. How clearly will they hear and see on the Day they\nwill come to Us! But today the wrongdoers are clearly astray.\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n39. And warn them ˹O Prophet˺ of the Day of Regret, when all matters will\nbe settled, while they are ˹engrossed˺ in heedlessness and disbelief. 40.\nIndeed, it is We Who will succeed the earth and whoever is on it. And to Us\nthey will ˹all˺ be returned.\nAbraham and His Father,\nȂzar\n41. And mention in the Book ˹O Prophet, the story of˺ Abraham. He was\nsurely a man of truth and a prophet. 42. ˹Remember˺ when he said to his\nfather, “O dear father! Why do you worship what can neither hear nor see,\nnor benefit you at all? 43. O dear father! I have certainly received some\nknowledge which you have not received, so follow me and I will guide you\nto the Straight Path. 44. O dear father! Do not worship Satan. Surely Satan\nis ever rebellious against the Most Compassionate. 45. O dear father! I truly\nfear that you will be touched by a torment from the Most Compassionate,\nand become Satan’s companion ˹in Hell˺.”\nȂzar’s Angry Response\n46. He threatened, “How dare you reject my idols, O Abraham! If you do\nnot desist, I will certainly stone you ˹to death˺. So be gone from me for a\nlong time!” 47. Abraham responded, “Peace be upon you! I will pray to my\n\n-- 269 of 694 --\n\nLord for your forgiveness. He has truly been Most Gracious to me. 48. As I\ndistance myself from ˹all of˺ you and from whatever you invoke besides\nAllah, I will ˹continue to˺ call upon my Lord ˹alone˺, trusting that I will\nnever be disappointed in invoking my Lord.” 49. So after he had left them\nand what they worshipped besides Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob,\nand made each of them a prophet. 50. We showered them with Our mercy,\nand blessed them with honourable mention.[576]\nProphet Moses\n51. And mention in the Book ˹O Prophet, the story of˺ Moses. He was truly\na chosen man, and was a messenger and a prophet. 52. We called him from\nthe right side of Mount Ṭûr, and drew him near, speaking ˹with him˺\ndirectly. 53. And We appointed for him—out of Our grace—his brother,\nAaron, as a prophet.\nProphet Ishmael\n54. And mention in the Book ˹O Prophet, the story of˺ Ishmael. He was\ntruly a man of his word, and was a messenger and a prophet. 55. He used to\nurge his people to pray and give alms-tax. And his Lord was well pleased\nwith him.\nProphet Enoch\n56. And mention in the Book ˹O Prophet, the story of˺ Enoch. He was\nsurely a man of truth and a prophet. 57. And We elevated him to an\nhonourable status.[577]\nNoble Prophets\n58. Those were ˹some of˺ the prophets who Allah has blessed from among\nthe descendants of Adam, and of those We carried with Noah ˹in the Ark˺,\nand of the descendants of Abraham and Israel,[578] and of those We ˹rightly˺\nguided and chose. Whenever the revelations of the Most Compassionate\nwere recited to them, they fell down, prostrating and weeping.\nEvil Successors\n59. But they were succeeded by generations who neglected prayer and\nfollowed their lusts and so will soon face the evil consequences.[579] 60. As\nfor those who repent, believe, and do good, it is they who will be admitted\ninto Paradise, never being denied any reward. 61. ˹They will be in˺ the\nGardens of Eternity, promised in trust by the Most Compassionate to His\n\n-- 270 of 694 --\n\nservants. Surely His promise will be fulfilled. 62. There they will never hear\nany idle talk—only ˹greetings of˺ peace. And there they will have their\nprovisions morning and evening.[580] 63. That is Paradise, which We will\ngrant to whoever is devout among Our servants.\nGabriel’s Response to the Prophet [581]\n64. “We only descend by the command of your Lord. To Him belongs\nwhatever is before us, and whatever is behind us, and everything in\nbetween. And your Lord is never forgetful. 65. ˹He is the˺ Lord of the\nheavens, and the earth, and everything in between. So worship Him ˹alone˺,\nand be steadfast in His worship. Do you know of anyone equal to Him ˹in\nHis attributes˺?”\nThe Deniers of Resurrection\n66. Yet ˹some˺ people ask ˹mockingly˺, “After I die, will I really be raised to\nlife again?” 67. Do ˹such˺ people not remember that We created them\nbefore, when they were nothing? 68. By your Lord ˹O Prophet˺! We will\nsurely gather them along with the devils, and then set them around Hell on\ntheir knees. 69. Then We will certainly begin by dragging out of every\ngroup the ones most defiant to the Most Compassionate. 70. And We truly\nknow best who is most deserving of burning in it. 71. There is none of you\nwho will not pass over it.[582] ˹This is˺ a decree your Lord must fulfil. 72.\nThen We will deliver those who were devout, leaving the wrongdoers there\non their knees.\nArrogant Disbelievers\n73. When Our clear revelations are recited to them, the disbelievers ask the\nbelievers ˹mockingly˺, “Which of the two of us is better in status and\nsuperior in assembly?” 74. ˹Imagine, O Prophet˺ how many peoples We\nhave destroyed before them, who were far better in luxury and splendour!\n75. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Whoever is ˹entrenched˺ in misguidance, the Most\nCompassionate will allow them plenty of time, until—behold!—they face\nwhat they are threatened with: either the torment or the Hour. Only then\nwill they realize who is worse in position and inferior in manpower.”\nReward of the Devout\n76. And Allah increases in guidance those who are ˹rightly˺ guided. And the\neverlasting good deeds are far better with your Lord in reward and in\n\n-- 271 of 694 --\n\noutcome.[583]\nA Denier of Resurrection\n77. Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ the one[584] who rejects Our revelations yet\nboasts, “I will definitely be granted ˹plenty of˺ wealth and children ˹if there\nis an afterlife˺.”? 78. Has he looked into the unseen or taken a pledge from\nthe Most Compassionate? 79. Not at all! We certainly record whatever he\nclaims and will increase his punishment extensively. 80. And We will\ninherit what he boasts of, and he will come before Us all by himself.\nBelievers and Disbelievers on Judgment Day\n81. They have taken other gods, instead of Allah, seeking strength ˹and\nprotection˺ through them. 82. But no! Those ˹gods˺ will deny their worship\nand turn against them. 83. Do you ˹O Prophet˺ not see that We have sent the\ndevils against the disbelievers, constantly inciting them? 84. So do not be in\nhaste against them, for indeed We are ˹closely˺ counting down their days.\n85. ˹Watch for˺ the Day We will gather the righteous before the Most\nCompassionate as an honoured delegation, 86. and drive the wicked to Hell\nlike a thirsty herd. 87. None will have the right to intercede, except those\nwho have taken a covenant from the Most Compassionate.[585]\nAllah’s Children?\n88. They[586] say, “The Most Compassionate has offspring.” 89. You have\ncertainly made an outrageous claim, 90. by which the heavens are about to\nburst, the earth to split apart, and the mountains to crumble to pieces 91. in\nprotest of attributing children to the Most Compassionate. 92. It does not\nbefit ˹the majesty of˺ the Most Compassionate to have children. 93. There is\nnone in the heavens or the earth who will not return to the Most\nCompassionate in full submission. 94. Indeed, He fully knows them and has\ncounted them precisely. 95. And each of them will return to Him on the Day\nof Judgment all alone.\nBelievers’ Love for One Another\n96. As for those who believe and do good, the Most Compassionate will\n˹certainly˺ bless them with ˹genuine˺ love.\nThe Message of the Quran\n97. Indeed, We have made this ˹Quran˺ easy in your own language ˹O\nProphet˺ so with it you may give good news to the righteous and warn those\n\n-- 272 of 694 --\n\nwho are contentious. 98. ˹Imagine˺ how many peoples We have destroyed\nbefore them! Do you ˹still˺ see any of them, or ˹even˺ hear from them the\nslightest sound?\n***\n\n-- 273 of 694 --\n\n20. Ṭâ-Hâ\n(\nṬâ-Hâ)\nSince Moses (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and Adam (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) are mentioned passingly in the\nprevious sûrah, their stories are recounted here in great detail. This Meccan\nsûrah reassures the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) that the truth always prevails even\nagainst the most tyrannical opposition (in the form of Pharaoh) and that\nAllah is able to open even the hardest of hearts (in the form of Pharaoh’s\nmagicians). Both the beginning and the end of the sûrah emphasize the\ndivine nature of the Quran as a source of guidance and eternal bliss. Those\nwho turn away from the Quranic reminder are warned of misery in this\nworld and horrifying punishment on the Day of Judgment. The Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is advised to seek comfort in patience and prayer against pagan\ndenial, which is detailed at the beginning of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAlmighty Allah’s Revelation\n1.\nṬâ-Hâ. 2. We have not revealed the Quran to you ˹O Prophet˺ to cause\nyou distress, 3. but as a reminder to those in awe ˹of Allah˺. 4. ˹It is˺ a\nrevelation from the One Who created the earth and the high heavens— 5.\nthe Most Compassionate, ˹Who is˺ established on the Throne. 6. To Him\nbelongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and\nwhatever is in between and whatever is underground. 7. Whether you speak\nopenly ˹or not˺, He certainly knows what is secret and what is even more\nhidden. 8. Allah—there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He has\nthe Most Beautiful Names.\nMoses’ Great Encounter\n9. Has the story of Moses reached you ˹O Prophet˺? 10. When he saw a fire,\nhe said to his family, “Wait here, ˹for˺ I have spotted a fire. Perhaps I can\nbring you a torch from it, or find some guidance at the fire.”[587] 11. But\nwhen he approached it, he was called, “O Moses! 12. It is truly I. I am your\nLord! So take off your sandals, for you are in the sacred valley of Ṭuwa. 13.\nI have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed: 14. ‘It is truly I. I am\n\n-- 274 of 694 --\n\nAllah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Me. So worship Me\n˹alone˺, and establish prayer for My remembrance. 15. The Hour is sure to\ncome. My Will is to keep it hidden, so that every soul may be rewarded\naccording to their efforts. 16. So do not let those who disbelieve in it and\nfollow their desires distract you from it, or you will be doomed.’”\nTwo Signs for Moses\n17. ˹Allah added,˺ “And what is that in your right hand, O Moses?” 18. He\nreplied, “It is my staff! I lean on it, and with it I beat down ˹branches˺ for\nmy sheep, and have other uses for it.”[588] 19. Allah said, “Throw it down,\nO Moses!” 20. So he did, then—behold!—it became a serpent, slithering.\n21. Allah said, “Take it, and have no fear. We will return it to its former\nstate. 22. And put your hand under your armpit, it will come out ˹shining˺\nwhite, unblemished,[589] as another sign, 23. so that We may show you\nsome of Our greatest signs. 24. Go to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed\n˹all bounds˺.”\nMoses Prays for Help\n25. Moses prayed, “My Lord! Uplift my heart for me, 26. and make my task\neasy, 27. and remove the impediment from my tongue 28. so people may\nunderstand my speech,[590] 29. and grant me a helper from my family, 30.\nAaron, my brother. 31. Strengthen me through him, 32. and let him share\nmy task, 33. so that we may glorify You much 34. and remember You\nmuch, 35. for truly You have ˹always˺ been overseeing us.” 36. Allah\nresponded, “All that you requested has been granted, O Moses!\nAllah’s Favours to Young Moses\n37. “And surely We had shown You favour before, 38. when We inspired\nyour mother with this: 39. ‘Put him into a chest, then put it into the river.\nThe river will wash it ashore, and he will be taken by ˹Pharaoh,˺ an enemy\nof Mine and his.’ And I blessed you with lovability from Me[591] ˹O Moses˺\nso that you would be brought up under My ˹watchful˺ Eye. 40. ˹Remember˺\nwhen your sister came along and proposed, ‘Shall I direct you to someone\nwho will nurse him?’[592] So We reunited you with your mother so that her\nheart would be put at ease, and she would not grieve. ˹Later˺ you killed a\nman ˹by mistake˺, but We saved you from sorrow, as well as other tests We\nput you through. Then you stayed for a number of years among the people\n\n-- 275 of 694 --\n\nof Midian. Then you came here as pre-destined, O Moses! 41. And I have\nselected you for My service.\nOrders to Moses and Aaron\n42. “Go forth, you and your brother, with My signs and never falter in\nremembering Me. 43. Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has truly\ntransgressed ˹all bounds˺. 44. Speak to him gently, so perhaps he may be\nmindful ˹of Me˺ or fearful ˹of My punishment˺.” 45. They both pleaded,\n“Our Lord! We fear that he may be quick to harm us or act tyrannically.”\n46. Allah reassured ˹them˺, “Have no fear! I am with you, hearing and\nseeing. 47. So go to him and say, ‘Indeed we are both messengers from your\nLord, so let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not oppress them. We\nhave come to you with a sign from your Lord. And salvation will be for\nwhoever follows the ˹right˺ guidance. 48. It has indeed been revealed to us\nthat the punishment will be upon whoever denies ˹the truth˺ and turns\naway.’”\nPharaoh’s Arrogance\n49. Pharaoh asked, “Who then is the Lord of you two, O Moses?” 50. He\nanswered, “Our Lord is the One Who has given everything its ˹distinctive˺\nform, then guided ˹it˺.” 51. Pharaoh asked, “And what about previous\npeoples?” 52. He replied, “That knowledge is with my Lord in a Record.\nMy Lord neither falters nor forgets ˹anything˺.” 53. ˹He is the One˺ Who\nhas laid out the earth for ˹all of˺ you, and set in it pathways for you, and\nsends down rain from the sky, causing various types of plants to grow, 54.\n˹so˺ eat and graze your cattle. Surely in this are signs for people of sound\njudgment. 55. From the earth We created you, and into it We will return\nyou, and from it We will bring you back again.\nThe Challenge\n56. And We certainly showed Pharaoh all of Our signs,[593] but he denied\nthem and refused ˹to believe˺. 57. He said, “Have you come to drive us out\nof our land with your magic, O Moses? 58. We can surely meet you with\nsimilar magic. So set for us an appointment that neither of us will fail to\nkeep, in a central place.” 59. Moses said, “Your appointment is on the Day\nof the Festival, and let the people be gathered mid-morning.”\nMoses’ Warning\n\n-- 276 of 694 --\n\n60. Pharaoh then withdrew, orchestrated his scheme, then returned. 61.\nMoses warned the magicians, “Woe to you! Do not fabricate a lie against\nAllah,[594] or He will wipe you out with a torment. Whoever fabricates ˹lies˺\nis bound to fail.” 62. So the magicians disputed the matter among\nthemselves, conversing privately. 63. They concluded, “These two are only\nmagicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic, and do\naway with your most cherished traditions. 64. So orchestrate your plan, then\ncome forward in ˹perfect˺ ranks. And whoever prevails today will certainly\nbe successful.”\nMoses Prevails\n65. They said, “O Moses! Either you cast, or let us be the first to cast.” 66.\nMoses responded, “No, you go first.” And suddenly their ropes and staffs\nappeared to him—by their magic—to be slithering. 67. So Moses concealed\nfear within himself. 68. We reassured ˹him˺, “Do not fear! It is certainly you\nwho will prevail. 69. Cast what is in your right hand, and it will swallow up\nwhat they have made, for what they have made is no more than a magic\ntrick. And magicians can never succeed wherever they go.”\nMagicians Become Believers\n70. So the magicians fell down in prostration, declaring, “We believe in the\nLord of Aaron and Moses.” 71. Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe\nin him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught\nyou magic. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides,\nand crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. You will really see whose\npunishment is more severe and more lasting.” 72. They responded, “By the\nOne Who created us! We will never prefer you over the clear proofs that\nhave come to us. So do whatever you want! Your authority only covers the\n˹fleeting˺ life of this world. 73. Indeed, we have believed in our Lord so He\nmay forgive our sins and that magic you have forced us to practice. And\nAllah is far superior ˹in reward˺ and more lasting ˹in punishment˺.”\nReward of Disbelievers and Believers\n74. Whoever comes to their Lord as an evildoer will certainly have Hell,\nwhere they can neither live nor die. 75. But whoever comes to Him as a\nbeliever, having done good, they will have the highest ranks: 76. the\nGardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, where they will stay forever.\nThat is the reward of those who purify themselves.\n\n-- 277 of 694 --\n\nPharaoh’s Doom\n77. And We surely inspired Moses, ˹saying,˺ “Leave with My servants ˹at\nnight˺ and strike a dry passage for them across the sea. Have no fear of\nbeing overtaken, nor be concerned ˹of drowning˺.” 78. Then Pharaoh\npursued them with his soldiers—but how overwhelming were the waters\nthat submerged them! 79. And ˹so˺ Pharaoh led his people astray, and did\nnot guide ˹them rightly˺.\nAllah’s Favours to the Israelites\n80. O Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemy, and made an\nappointment with you[595] on the right side of Mount Ṭûr, and sent down to\nyou manna and quails,[596] 81. ˹saying,˺ “Eat from the good things We have\nprovided for you, but do not transgress in them, or My wrath will befall\nyou. And whoever My wrath befalls is certainly doomed. 82. But I am truly\nMost Forgiving to whoever repents, believes, and does good, then persists\non ˹true˺ guidance.”\nThe Golden Calf\n83. ˹Allah asked,˺ “Why have you come with such haste ahead of your\npeople, O Moses?”[597] 84. He replied, “They are close on my tracks. And I\nhave hastened to You, my Lord, so You will be pleased.” 85. Allah\nresponded, “We have indeed tested your people in your absence, and the\nSâmiri[598] has led them astray.” 86. So Moses returned to his people,\nfurious and sorrowful. He said, “O my people! Had your Lord not made you\na good promise?[599] Has my absence been too long for you? Or have you\nwished for wrath from your Lord to befall you, so you broke your promise\nto me?”[600]\nThe Calf Worshippers\n87. They argued, “We did not break our promise to you of our own free\nwill, but we were made to carry the burden of the people’s ˹golden˺\njewellery,[601] then we threw it ˹into the fire˺, and so did the Sâmiri.” 88.\nThen he moulded for them an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. They\nsaid, “This is your god and the god of Moses, but Moses forgot ˹where it\nwas˺!” 89. Did they not see that it did not respond to them, nor could it\nprotect or benefit them?\nAaron’s Stance\n\n-- 278 of 694 --\n\n90. Aaron had already warned them beforehand, “O my people! You are\nonly being tested by this, for indeed your ˹one true˺ Lord is the Most\nCompassionate. So follow me and obey my orders.” 91. They replied, “We\nwill not cease to worship it until Moses returns to us.” 92. Moses scolded\n˹his brother˺, “O Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them going\nastray, 93. from following after me? How could you disobey my\norders?”[602] 94. Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! Do not seize me by\nmy beard or ˹the hair of˺ my head. I really feared that you would say, ‘You\nhave caused division among the Children of Israel, and did not observe my\nword.’”\nThe Sâmiri’s Punishment\n95. Moses then asked, “What did you think you were doing, O Sâmiri?” 96.\nHe said, “I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful ˹of dust˺ from the\nhoof-prints of ˹the horse of˺ the messenger-angel ˹Gabriel˺ then cast it ˹on\nthe moulded calf˺. This is what my lower-self tempted me into.”[603] 97.\nMoses said, “Go away then! And for ˹the rest of your˺ life you will surely\nbe crying, ‘Do not touch ˹me˺!’[604] Then you will certainly have a fate[605]\nthat you cannot escape. Now look at your god to which you have been\ndevoted: we will burn it up, then scatter it in the sea completely.” 98. ˹Then\nMoses addressed his people,˺ “Your only god is Allah, there is no god\n˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He encompasses everything in ˹His˺\nknowledge.”\nThe Deniers of the Quran\n99. This is how We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ some of the stories of the past.\nAnd We have certainly granted you a Reminder[606] from Us. 100. Whoever\nturns away from it will surely bear the burden ˹of sin˺ on the Day of\nJudgment, 101. suffering its consequences forever. What an evil burden\nthey will carry on Judgment Day! 102. ˹Beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet\nwill be blown,[607] and We will gather the wicked on that Day blue-faced\n˹from horror and thirst˺.[608] 103. They will whisper among themselves,\n“You stayed no more than ten days ˹on the earth˺.” 104. We know best what\nthey will say—the most reasonable of them will say, “You stayed no more\nthan a day.”\nMountains on Judgment Day\n\n-- 279 of 694 --\n\n105. And ˹if˺ they ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the mountains, ˹then˺ say, “My\nLord will wipe them out completely, 106. leaving the earth level and bare,\n107. with neither depressions nor elevations to be seen.”\nPeople on Judgment Day\n108. On that Day all will follow the caller ˹for assembly˺, ˹and˺ none will\ndare to deviate. All voices will be hushed before the Most Compassionate.\nOnly whispers[609] will be heard. 109. On that Day no intercession will be\nof any benefit, except by those granted permission by the Most\nCompassionate and whose words are agreeable to Him. 110. He ˹fully˺\nknows what is ahead of them and what is behind them,[610] but they cannot\nencompass Him in ˹their˺ knowledge.[611] 111. And all faces will be\nhumbled before the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. And those burdened with\nwrongdoing will be in loss. 112. But whoever does good and is a believer\nwill have no fear of being wronged or denied ˹their reward˺.\nThe Quran\n113. And so We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran and varied the\nwarnings in it, so perhaps they will shun evil or it may cause them to be\nmindful. 114. Exalted is Allah, the True King! Do not rush to recite ˹a\nrevelation of˺ the Quran ˹O Prophet˺ before it is ˹properly˺ conveyed to you,\n[612] and pray, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.”\nSatan vs. Adam\n115. And indeed, We once made a covenant with Adam, but he forgot, and\n˹so˺ We did not find determination in him. 116. And ˹remember˺ when We\nsaid to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,\n[613] who refused ˹arrogantly˺. 117. So We cautioned, “O Adam! This is\nsurely an enemy to you and to your wife. So do not let him drive you both\nout of Paradise, for you ˹O Adam˺ would then suffer ˹hardship˺. 118. Here it\nis guaranteed that you will never go hungry or unclothed, 119. nor will you\n˹ever˺ suffer from thirst or ˹the sun’s˺ heat.”[614]\nThe Temptation\n120. But Satan whispered to him, saying, “O Adam! Shall I show you the\nTree of Immortality and a kingdom that does not fade away?” 121. So they\nboth ate from the tree and then their nakedness was exposed to them,\nprompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise. So Adam\n\n-- 280 of 694 --\n\ndisobeyed his Lord, and ˹so˺ lost his way.[615] 122. Then his Lord chose him\n˹for His grace˺, accepted his repentance, and guided him ˹rightly˺.\nThe Fall\n123. Allah said, “Descend, both of you, from here together ˹with Satan˺ as\nenemies to each other. Then when guidance comes to you from Me,\nwhoever follows My guidance will neither go astray ˹in this life˺ nor suffer\n˹in the next˺. 124. But whoever turns away from My Reminder will\ncertainly have a miserable life,[616] then We will raise them up blind on the\nDay of Judgment.” 125. They will cry, “My Lord! Why have you raised me\nup blind, although I used to see?” 126. Allah will respond, “It is so, just as\nOur revelations came to you and you neglected them, so Today you are\nneglected.” 127. This is how We reward whoever transgresses and does not\nbelieve in the revelations of their Lord. And the punishment of the\nHereafter is far more severe and more lasting.\nWarning to Meccan Pagans\n128. Is it not yet clear to them how many peoples We destroyed before\nthem, whose ruins they still pass by? Surely in this are signs for people of\nsound judgment. 129. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord[617]\n˹O Prophet˺ and a term already set, their ˹instant˺ doom would have been\ninevitable.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n130. So be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And glorify the praises\nof your Lord before sunrise and before sunset, and glorify Him in the hours\nof the night and at both ends of the day,[618] so that you may be pleased\n˹with the reward˺. 131. Do not let your eyes crave what We have allowed\nsome of the disbelievers to enjoy; the ˹fleeting˺ splendour of this worldly\nlife, which We test them with. But your Lord’s provision ˹in the Hereafter˺\nis far better and more lasting. 132. Bid your people to pray, and be diligent\nin ˹observing˺ it. We do not ask you to provide. It is We Who provide for\nyou. And the ultimate outcome is ˹only˺ for ˹the people of˺ righteousness.\nWarning to the Pagans\n133. They demand, “If only he could bring us a sign from his Lord!”[619]\nHave they not ˹already˺ received a confirmation of what is in earlier\nScriptures?[620] 134. Had We destroyed them with a torment before this\n\n-- 281 of 694 --\n\n˹Prophet came˺, they would have surely argued, “Our Lord! If only You had\nsent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations before being\nhumiliated and put to shame.” 135. Say ˹to them, O Prophet˺, “Each ˹of us˺\nis waiting, so keep waiting! You will soon know who is on the Straight Path\nand is ˹rightly˺ guided.”\n***\n\n-- 282 of 694 --\n\n21. The Prophets\n(Al-Anbiyâ')\nLike the previous sûrah, this is another Meccan sûrah that aims at\nreassuring the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) by reminding him of Allah’s grace and\nsupport to His prophets, including Abraham, Job, Jonah, Zachariah, and\nJesus. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is said to be sent as a mercy to the whole world\n(verse 107). Warnings of the horrors of Judgment Day are dispersed\nthroughout the sûrah and are carried over to the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nIndifference to the Truth\n1. ˹The time of˺ people’s judgment has drawn near, yet they are heedlessly\nturning away. 2. Whatever new reminder comes to them from their Lord,\nthey only listen to it jokingly, 3. with their hearts ˹totally˺ distracted. The\nevildoers would converse secretly, ˹saying,˺ “Is this ˹one˺ not human like\nyourselves? Would you fall for ˹this˺ witchcraft, even though you can\n˹clearly˺ see?” 4. The Prophet responded, “My Lord ˹fully˺ knows every\nword spoken in the heavens and the earth. For He is the All-Hearing, All-\nKnowing.” 5. Yet they say, “This ˹Quran˺ is a set of confused dreams! No,\nhe has fabricated it! No, he must be a poet! So let him bring us a ˹tangible˺\nsign like those ˹prophets˺ sent before.” 6. Not a ˹single˺ society We\ndestroyed before them ever believed ˹after receiving the signs˺. Will these\n˹pagans˺ then believe?\nHuman, Not Angelic Messengers\n7. We did not send ˹messengers˺ before you ˹O Prophet˺ except mere men\ninspired by Us. If you ˹polytheists˺ do not know ˹this already˺, then ask\nthose who have knowledge ˹of the Scriptures˺. 8. We did not give those\nmessengers ˹supernatural˺ bodies that did not need food, nor were they\nimmortal. 9. Then We fulfilled Our promise to them, saving them along\nwith whoever We willed and destroying the transgressors.\nReasoning with Meccan Pagans\n\n-- 283 of 694 --\n\n10. We have surely revealed to you a Book, in which there is glory for you.\nWill you not then understand? 11. ˹Imagine˺ how many societies of\nwrongdoers We have destroyed, raising up other people after them! 12.\nWhen the wrongdoers sensed ˹the arrival of˺ Our torment, they started to\nrun away from their cities. 13. ˹They were told,˺ “Do not run away! Return\nto your luxuries and your homes, so you may be questioned ˹about your\nfate˺.” 14. They cried, “Woe to us! We have surely been wrongdoers.” 15.\nThey kept repeating their cry until We mowed them down, ˹leaving them˺\nlifeless.[621]\nDivine Amusement?\n16. We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in between\nfor sport. 17. Had We intended to take ˹some˺ amusement, We could have\nfound it in Our presence, if that had been Our Will. 18. In fact, We hurl the\ntruth against falsehood, leaving it crushed, and it quickly vanishes. And\nwoe be to you for what you claim![622] 19. To Him belong all those in the\nheavens and the earth. And those nearest to Him are not too proud to\nworship Him, nor do they tire. 20. They glorify ˹Him˺ day and night, never\nwavering.\nFalse Gods\n21. Or have they taken gods from the earth, who can raise the dead? 22.\nHad there been other gods besides Allah in the heavens or the earth, both\n˹realms˺ would have surely been corrupted. So Glorified is Allah, Lord of\nthe Throne, far above what they claim. 23. He cannot be questioned about\nwhat He does, but they will ˹all˺ be questioned. 24. Or have they taken other\ngods besides Him? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof. Here is ˹the\nQuran,˺ the Reminder for those with me; along with ˹earlier Scriptures,˺ the\nReminder for those before me.”[623] But most of them do not know the\ntruth, so they turn away. 25. We never sent a messenger before you ˹O\nProphet˺ without revealing to him: “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺\nexcept Me, so worship Me ˹alone˺.”\nA Pagan Claim\n26. And they say, “The Most Compassionate has offspring!”[624] Glory be\nto Him! In fact, those ˹angels˺ are only ˹His˺ honoured servants, 27. who do\nnot speak until He has spoken, ˹only˺ acting at His command. 28. He ˹fully˺\n\n-- 284 of 694 --\n\nknows what is ahead of them and what is behind them. They do not\nintercede except for whom He approves, and they tremble in awe of Him.\n29. Whoever of them were to say, “I am a god besides Him,” they would be\nrewarded with Hell by Us. This is how We reward the wrongdoers.\nMiracles in the Universe\n30. Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were ˹once˺\none mass then We split them apart?[625] And We created from water every\nliving thing. Will they not then believe? 31. And We have placed firm\nmountains upon the earth so it does not shake with them, and made in it\nbroad pathways so they may find their way. 32. And We have made the sky\na well-protected canopy, still they turn away from its signs.[626] 33. And He\nis the One Who created the day and the night, the sun and the moon—each\ntravelling in an orbit.\nFleeting World\n34. We have not granted immortality to any human before you ˹O Prophet˺:\nso if you die, will they live forever? 35. Every soul will taste death. And We\ntest you ˹O humanity˺ with good and evil as a trial, then to Us you will ˹all˺\nbe returned.\nWarning to the Polytheists\n36. When the disbelievers see you ˹O Prophet˺, they only make fun of you,\n˹saying,˺ “Is this the one who speaks ˹ill˺ of your gods?” while they\ndisbelieve at the mention of the Most Compassionate. 37. Humankind is\nmade of haste. I will soon show you My signs, so do not ask Me to hasten\nthem. 38. They ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass if\nwhat you say is true?” 39. If only the disbelievers knew that a time will\ncome when they will not be able to keep the Fire off their faces or backs,\nnor will they be helped. 40. In fact, the Hour will take them by surprise,\nleaving them stunned. So they will not be able to avert it, nor will it be\ndelayed from them. 41. ˹Other˺ messengers had already been ridiculed\nbefore you ˹O Prophet˺, but those who mocked them were overtaken by\nwhat they used to ridicule.\nQuestions to the Pagans\n42. Ask ˹them, O Prophet,˺ “Who can defend you by day or by night against\nthe Most Compassionate?” Still they turn away from the remembrance of\n\n-- 285 of 694 --\n\ntheir Lord. 43. Or do they have gods—other than Us—that can protect\nthem? They cannot ˹even˺ protect themselves, nor will they be aided against\nUs. 44. In fact, We have allowed enjoyment for these ˹Meccans˺ and their\nforefathers for such a long time ˹that they took it for granted˺. Do they not\nsee that We gradually reduce ˹their˺ land from its borders? Is it they who\nwill then prevail?\nWarning of Torment\n45. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I warn you only by revelation.” But the deaf cannot\nhear the call when they are warned! 46. If they were touched by even a\nbreath of your Lord’s torment, they would certainly cry, “Woe to us! We\nhave really been wrongdoers.”\nDivine Justice\n47. We will set up the scales of justice on the Day of Judgment, so no soul\nwill be wronged in the least. And ˹even˺ if a deed is the weight of a mustard\nseed, We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner.\nThe Torah\n48. Indeed, We granted Moses and Aaron the standard ˹to distinguish\nbetween right and wrong˺—a light and a reminder for the righteous, 49.\nwho are in awe of their Lord without seeing Him,[627] and are fearful of the\nHour.\nThe Quran\n50. And this ˹Quran˺ is a blessed reminder which We have revealed. Will\nyou ˹pagans˺ then deny it?\nProphet Abraham\n51. And indeed, We had granted Abraham sound judgment early on, for We\nknew him well ˹to be worthy of it˺. 52. ˹Remember˺ when he questioned his\nfather and his people, “What are these statues to which you are so\ndevoted?” 53. They replied, “We found our forefathers worshipping them.”\n54. He responded, “Indeed, you and your forefathers have been clearly\nastray.” 55. They asked, “Have you come to us with the truth, or is this a\njoke?” 56. He replied, “In fact, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the\nearth, Who created them ˹both˺. And to that I bear witness.” 57. ˹Then he\nsaid to himself,˺ “By Allah! I will surely plot against your idols after you\n\n-- 286 of 694 --\n\nhave turned your backs and gone away.” 58. So he smashed them into\npieces, except the biggest of them, so they might turn to it ˹for answers˺.\nHis People’s Reaction\n59. They protested, “Who dared do this to our gods? It must be an\nevildoer!” 60. Some said, “We heard a young man, called Abraham,\nspeaking ˹ill˺ of them.” 61. They demanded, “Bring him before the eyes of\nthe people, so that they may witness ˹his trial˺.” 62. They asked, “Was it\nyou who did this to our gods, O Abraham?” 63. He replied ˹sarcastically˺,\n“No, this one—the biggest of them—did it! So ask them, if they can talk!”\n64. So they came back to their senses, saying ˹to one another˺, “You\nyourselves are truly the wrongdoers!” 65. Then they ˹quickly˺ regressed to\ntheir ˹original˺ mind-set, ˹arguing,˺ “You already know that those ˹idols˺\ncannot talk.” 66. He rebuked ˹them˺, “Do you then worship—instead of\nAllah—what can neither benefit nor harm you in any way? 67. Shame on\nyou and whatever you worship instead of Allah! Do you not have any\nsense?” 68. They concluded, “Burn him up to avenge your gods, if you\nmust act.”\nAbraham Prevails\n69. We ordered, “O fire! Be cool and safe for Abraham!”[628] 70. They had\nsought to harm him, but We made them the worst losers. 71. Then We\ndelivered him, along with Lot, to the land We had showered with blessings\nfor all people.[629] 72. And We blessed him with Isaac ˹as a son˺ and Jacob\n˹as a grandson˺, as an additional favour—making all of them righteous. 73.\nWe ˹also˺ made them leaders, guiding by Our command, and inspired them\nto do good deeds, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. And they were\ndevoted to Our worship.\nProphet Lot\n74. And to Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and delivered him from\nthe society engrossed in shameful practices. They were certainly an evil,\nrebellious people. 75. And We admitted him into Our mercy, ˹for˺ he was\ntruly one of the righteous.\nProphet Noah\n76. And ˹remember˺ when Noah had cried out to Us earlier, so We\nresponded to him and delivered him and his family[630] from the great\n\n-- 287 of 694 --\n\ndistress. 77. And We made him prevail over those who had rejected Our\nsigns. They were truly an evil people, so We drowned them all.\nProphet David and Prophet Solomon\n78. And ˹remember˺ when David and Solomon passed judgment regarding\nthe crops ruined ˹at night˺ by someone’s sheep, and We were witness to\ntheir judgments. 79. We guided ˹young˺ Solomon to a fairer settlement,[631]\nand granted each of them wisdom and knowledge. We subjected the\nmountains as well as the birds to hymn ˹Our praises˺ along with David. It is\nWe Who did ˹it all˺. 80. We taught him the art of making body armour to\nprotect you in battle. Will you then be grateful? 81. And to Solomon We\nsubjected the raging winds, blowing by his command to the land We had\nshowered with blessings. It is We Who know everything. 82. And ˹We\nsubjected˺ some jinn[632] that dived for him,[633] and performed other duties.\nIt is We Who kept them in check.\nProphet Job\n83. And ˹remember˺ when Job cried out to his Lord, “I have been touched\nwith adversity,[634] and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” 84. So\nWe answered his prayer and removed his adversity, and gave him back his\nfamily, twice as many, as a mercy from Us and a lesson for the ˹devoted˺\nworshippers.\nMore Prophets\n85. And ˹remember˺ Ishmael, Enoch, and Ⱬul-Kifl.[635] They were all\nsteadfast. 86. We admitted them into Our mercy, for they were truly of the\nrighteous.\nProphet Jonah\n87. And ˹remember˺ when the Man of the Whale stormed off ˹from his city˺\nin a rage, thinking We would not restrain him.[636] Then in the ˹veils of˺\ndarkness[637] he cried out, “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except You.\nGlory be to You! I have certainly done wrong.” 88. So We answered his\nprayer and rescued him from anguish. And so do We save the ˹true˺\nbelievers.\nProphet Zachariah\n89. And ˹remember˺ when Zachariah cried out to his Lord, “My Lord! Do\nnot leave me childless, though You are the Best of Successors.”[638] 90. So\n\n-- 288 of 694 --\n\nWe answered his prayer, granted him John, and made his wife fertile.\nIndeed, they used to race in doing good, and call upon Us with hope and\nfear, totally humbling themselves before Us.\nProphet Jesus and His Mother\n91. And ˹remember˺ the one who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into\nher through Our angel, ˹Gabriel,˺[639] making her and her son a sign for all\npeoples.\nOne Way\n92. ˹O prophets!˺ Indeed, this religion of yours is ˹only˺ one, and I am your\nLord, so worship Me ˹alone˺. 93. Yet the people have divided it into sects.\nBut to Us they will all return. 94. So whoever does good and is a believer\nwill never be denied ˹the reward for˺ their striving, for We are recording it\nall.\nThe People of Hell\n95. It is impossible for a society which We have destroyed to ever rise\nagain, 96. until ˹after˺ Gog and Magog have broken loose ˹from the barrier˺,\n[640] swarming down from every hill, 97. ushering in the True Promise.[641]\nThen—behold!—the disbelievers will stare ˹in horror, crying,˺ “Oh, woe to\nus! We have truly been heedless of this. In fact, we have been wrongdoers.”\n98. Certainly you ˹disbelievers˺ and whatever you worship instead of Allah\nwill be the fuel of Hell.[642] You are ˹all˺ bound to enter it. 99. Had those\nidols been ˹true˺ gods, they would not have entered it. And they will be\nthere forever. 100. In it they will groan, and will not be able to hear.\nThe People of Paradise\n101. Surely those for whom We have destined the finest reward will be kept\nfar away from Hell, 102. not even hearing the slightest hissing from it. And\nthey will delight forever in what their souls desire. 103. The Supreme\nHorror ˹of that Day˺ will not disturb them, and the angels will greet them,\n˹saying,˺ “This is your Day, which you have been promised.” 104. On that\nDay We will roll up the heavens like a scroll of writings. Just as We\nproduced the first creation, ˹so˺ shall We reproduce it. That is a promise\nbinding on Us. We truly uphold ˹Our promises˺! 105. Surely, following the\n˹heavenly˺ Record, We decreed in the Scriptures: “My righteous servants\nshall inherit the land.”[643]\n\n-- 289 of 694 --\n\nAdvice for the Prophet\n106. Surely this ˹Quran˺ is sufficient ˹as a reminder˺ for those devoted to\nworship. 107. We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a mercy for the whole\nworld. 108. Say, “What has been revealed to me is this: ‘Your God is only\nOne God.’ Will you then submit?” 109. If they turn away, then say, “I have\nwarned you all equally. I do not know if what you are threatened with is\nnear or far. 110. Allah surely knows what you say openly and whatever you\nhide. 111. I do not know if this ˹delay˺ is possibly a test for you and an\nenjoyment for a while.” 112. ˹In the end,˺ the Prophet said, “My Lord!\nJudge ˹between us˺ in truth. And our Lord is the Most Compassionate,\nWhose help is sought against what you claim.”[644]\n***\n\n-- 290 of 694 --\n\n22. The Pilgrimage\n(Al-\nḤajj)\nThis Medinian sûrah takes its name from the passage that talks about\npilgrimage rituals (verses 25-37), along with condemnations to the pagans\nfor hindering the believers from reaching the Sacred House in Mecca. After\nfifteen years of persecution, here the believers receive the permission to\nfight back in self-defence (verse 39). Idolatry is condemned and the idols\nare rejected as pathetic, incapable of even creating a fly. In conclusion, the\nbelievers are told that they can achieve success through prayer and good\ndeeds—a theme which extends to the beginning of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Horror of Judgment Day\n1. O humanity! Fear your Lord, for the ˹violent˺ quaking at the Hour is\nsurely a dreadful thing. 2. The Day you see it, every nursing mother will\nabandon what she is nursing, and every pregnant woman will deliver her\nburden ˹prematurely˺. And you will see people ˹as if they were˺ drunk,\nthough they will not be drunk; but the torment of Allah is ˹terribly˺ severe.\nDenying Allah’s Might\n3. ˹Still˺ there are some who dispute about Allah without knowledge, and\nfollow every rebellious devil. 4. It has been decreed for such devils that\nwhoever takes them as a guide will be misguided and led by them into the\ntorment of the Blaze.\nAllah’s Power to Create\n5. O humanity! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then ˹know that˺\nWe did create you[645] from dust, then from a sperm-drop,[646] then\n˹developed you into˺ a clinging clot ˹of blood˺,[647] then a lump of flesh[648]\n—fully formed or unformed[649]—in order to demonstrate ˹Our power˺ to\nyou. ˹Then˺ We settle whatever ˹embryo˺ We will in the womb for an\nappointed term, then bring you forth as infants, so that you may reach your\nprime. Some of you ˹may˺ die ˹young˺, while others are left to reach the\nmost feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known\n\n-- 291 of 694 --\n\nmuch. And you see the earth lifeless, but as soon as We send down rain\nupon it, it begins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell, producing every type of pleasant\nplant. 6. That is because Allah ˹alone˺ is the Truth, He ˹alone˺ gives life to\nthe dead, and He ˹alone˺ is Most Capable of everything. 7. And certainly the\nHour is coming, there is no doubt about it. And Allah will surely resurrect\nthose in the graves.\nPunishment of the Wicked\n8. ˹Still˺ there are some who dispute about Allah without knowledge,\nguidance, or an enlightening scripture, 9. turning away ˹in pride˺ to lead\n˹others˺ astray from Allah’s Way. They will suffer disgrace in this world,\nand on the Day of Judgment We will make them taste the torment of\nburning. 10. ˹They will be told,˺ “This is ˹the reward˺ for what your hands\nhave done. And Allah is never unjust to ˹His˺ creation.”\nHalf-Hearted Worship\n11. And there are some who worship Allah on the verge ˹of faith˺: if they\nare blessed with something good, they are content with it; but if they are\nafflicted with a trial, they relapse ˹into disbelief˺,[650] losing this world and\nthe Hereafter. That is ˹truly˺ the clearest loss. 12. They call besides Allah\nwhat can neither harm nor benefit them. That is ˹truly˺ the farthest one can\nstray. 13. They invoke those whose worship leads to harm, not benefit.\nWhat an evil patron and what an evil associate!\nReward of True Believers\n14. Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and do good into Gardens,\nunder which rivers flow. Surely Allah does what He wills.\nA Challenge to the Cynics\n15. Whoever thinks that Allah will not help His Prophet in this world and\nthe Hereafter, let them stretch out a rope to the ceiling and strangle\nthemselves, then let them see if this plan will do away with ˹the cause of˺\ntheir rage.[651]\nThe Sole Guide and Judge\n16. And so We revealed this ˹Quran˺ as clear verses. And Allah certainly\nguides whoever He wills. 17. Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians,[652]\nChristians, Magi,[653] and the polytheists—Allah will judge between them\n˹all˺ on Judgment Day. Surely Allah is a Witness over all things.\n\n-- 292 of 694 --\n\nSubmission to the Almighty\n18. Do you not see that to Allah bow down ˹in submission˺[654] all those in\nthe heavens and all those on the earth, as well as the sun, the moon, the\nstars, the mountains, the trees, and ˹all˺ living beings, as well as many\nhumans, while many are deserving of punishment. And whoever Allah\ndisgraces, none can honour. Surely Allah does what He wills.\nThe Believers and Disbelievers\n19. These are two opposing groups that disagree about their Lord: as for the\ndisbelievers, garments of Fire will be cut out for them and boiling water\nwill be poured over their heads, 20. melting whatever is in their bellies,\nalong with their skin. 21. And awaiting them are maces of iron. 22.\nWhenever they try to escape from Hell—out of anguish—they will be\nforced back into it, ˹and will be told,˺ “Taste the torment of burning!” 23.\n˹But˺ Allah will surely admit those who believe and do good into Gardens,\nunder which rivers flow, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold\nand pearls, and their clothing will be silk, 24. for they have been guided to\nthe best of speech, and they have been guided to the Commendable Path.\n[655]\nViolating the Sacred Mosque[656]\n25. Indeed, those who persist in disbelief and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way\nof Allah and from the Sacred Mosque[657]—which We have appointed for\nall people, residents and visitors alike—along with whoever intends to\ndeviate by doing wrong in it,[658] We will cause them to taste a painful\npunishment.\nThe Pilgrimage\n26. And ˹remember˺ when We assigned to Abraham the site of the House,\n˹saying,˺ “Do not associate anything with Me ˹in worship˺ and purify My\nHouse for those who circle ˹the Ka’bah˺, stand ˹in prayer˺, and bow and\nprostrate themselves. 27. Call ˹all˺ people to the pilgrimage.[659] They will\ncome to you on foot and on every lean camel from every distant path, 28. so\nthey may obtain the benefits ˹in store˺ for them,[660] and pronounce the\nName of Allah on appointed days over the sacrificial animals He has\nprovided for them. So eat from their meat and feed the desperately poor. 29.\n\n-- 293 of 694 --\n\nThen let them groom themselves,[661] fulfil their vows, and circle the\nAncient House.”\nTotal Devotion to Allah\n30. That is so. And whoever honours the rituals of Allah, it is best for them\nin the sight of their Lord. The ˹meat of˺ cattle has been made lawful for you,\nexcept what has ˹already˺ been recited to you.[662] So shun the impurity of\nidolatry, and shun words of falsehood. 31. Be upright ˹in devotion˺ to Allah,\nassociating none with Him ˹in worship˺. For whoever associates ˹others˺\nwith Allah is like someone who has fallen from the sky and is either\nsnatched away by birds or swept by the wind to a remote place. 32. That is\nso. And whoever honours the symbols of Allah, it is certainly out of the\npiety of the heart. 33. You may benefit from sacrificial animals for an\nappointed term,[663] then their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House.\nGood News for the Humble\n34. For every community We appointed a rite of sacrifice so that they may\npronounce the Name of Allah over the sacrificial animals He has provided\nfor them. For your God is only One God, so submit yourselves to Him\n˹alone˺. And give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the humble: 35. those whose\nhearts tremble at the remembrance of Allah, who patiently endure whatever\nmay befall them, and who establish prayer and donate from what We have\nprovided for them.\nPurpose of Sacrificial Animals\n36. We have made sacrificial camels ˹and cattle˺ among the symbols of\nAllah, in which there is ˹much˺ good for you. So pronounce the Name of\nAllah over them when they are lined up ˹for sacrifice˺. Once they have\nfallen ˹lifeless˺ on their sides, you may eat from their meat, and feed the\nneedy—those who do not beg, and those who do. In this way We have\nsubjected these ˹animals˺ to you so that you may be grateful. 37. Neither\ntheir meat nor blood reaches Allah. Rather, it is your piety that reaches\nHim. This is how He has subjected them to you so that you may proclaim\nthe greatness of Allah for what He has guided you to, and give good news\nto the good-doers.\nPermission to Fight in Self-Defence\n\n-- 294 of 694 --\n\n38. Indeed, Allah defends those who believe. Surely Allah does not like\nwhoever is deceitful, ungrateful. 39. Permission ˹to fight back˺ is ˹hereby˺\ngranted to those being fought, for they have been wronged.[664] And Allah\nis truly Most Capable of helping them ˹prevail˺. 40. ˹They are˺ those who\nhave been expelled from their homes for no reason other than proclaiming:\n“Our Lord is Allah.” Had Allah not repelled ˹the aggression of˺ some\npeople by means of others, destruction would have surely claimed\nmonasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which Allah’s Name is\noften mentioned. Allah will certainly help those who stand up for Him.\nAllah is truly All-Powerful, Almighty. 41. ˹They are˺ those who, if\nestablished in the land by Us, would perform prayer, pay alms-tax,\nencourage what is good, and forbid what is evil. And with Allah rests the\noutcome of all affairs.\nWarning to Meccan Pagans\n42. If they deny you ˹O Prophet˺, so did the people of Noah before them, as\nwell as ˹the tribes of˺ ’Ȃd and Thamûd, 43. the people of Abraham, the\npeople of Lot, 44. and the residents of Midian. And Moses was denied ˹too˺.\nBut I delayed ˹the fate of˺ the disbelievers ˹until their appointed time˺ then\nseized them. And how severe was My response! 45. Many are the societies\nWe have destroyed for persisting in wrongdoing, leaving them in total ruin.\n˹Many are˺ also the abandoned wells and lofty palaces! 46. Have they not\ntravelled throughout the land so their hearts may reason, and their ears may\nlisten? Indeed, it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts in the\nchests that grow blind. 47. They challenge you ˹O Prophet˺ to hasten the\ntorment. And Allah will never fail in His promise. But a day with your Lord\nis indeed like a thousand years by your counting. 48. Many are the societies\nwhose end We delayed while they did wrong, then seized them. And to Me\nis the final return.\nThe Prophet’s Duty\n49. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! I am only sent to you with a clear\nwarning. 50. So those who believe and do good will have forgiveness and\nan honourable provision. 51. But those who strive to discredit Our\nrevelations, they will be the residents of the Hellfire.”\nSatan’s Influence\n\n-- 295 of 694 --\n\n52. Whenever We sent a messenger or a prophet before you ˹O Prophet˺ and\nhe recited ˹Our revelations˺, Satan would influence ˹people’s understanding\nof˺ his recitation. But ˹eventually˺ Allah would eliminate Satan’s influence.\nThen Allah would ˹firmly˺ establish His revelations. And Allah is All-\nKnowing, All-Wise. 53. All that so He may make Satan’s influence a trial\nfor those ˹hypocrites˺ whose hearts are sick and those ˹disbelievers˺ whose\nhearts are hardened. Surely the wrongdoers are totally engrossed in\nopposition. 54. ˹This is˺ also so that those gifted with knowledge would\nknow that this ˹revelation˺ is the truth from your Lord, so they have faith in\nit, and so their hearts would submit humbly to it. And Allah surely guides\nthe believers to the Straight Path. 55. Yet the disbelievers will persist in\ndoubt about this ˹revelation˺ until the Hour takes them by surprise, or the\ntorment of a terminating[665] Day comes to them.\nJustice on Judgment Day\n56. All authority on that Day is for Allah ˹alone˺.[666] He will judge between\nthem. So those who believe and do good will be in the Gardens of Bliss. 57.\nBut those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, it is they who will\nsuffer a humiliating punishment. 58. As for those who emigrate in the cause\nof Allah and then are martyred or die, Allah will indeed grant them a good\nprovision. Surely Allah is the Best Provider. 59. He will certainly admit\nthem into a place they will be pleased with. For Allah is truly All-Knowing,\nMost Forbearing.\nDivine Justice\n60. That is so. And whoever retaliates in equivalence to the injury they have\nreceived, and then are wronged ˹again˺, Allah will certainly help them.\nSurely Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.\nAllah’s Power\n61. That is because Allah causes the night to merge into the day, and the\nday into the night. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. 62. That is\nbecause Allah ˹alone˺ is the Truth and what they invoke besides Him is\nfalsehood, and Allah ˹alone˺ is truly the Most High, All-Great. 63. Do you\nnot see that Allah sends down rain from the sky, then the earth becomes\ngreen? Surely Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware. 64. To Him belongs\n\n-- 296 of 694 --\n\nwhatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Allah ˹alone˺ is\ntruly the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.\nAllah’s Grace\n65. Do you not see that Allah has subjected to you[667] whatever is in the\nearth as well as the ships ˹that˺ sail through the sea by His command? He\nkeeps the sky from falling down on the earth except by His permission.\nSurely Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity. 66. And He\nis the One Who gave you life, then will cause you to die, and then will\nbring you back to life. ˹But˺ surely humankind is ever ungrateful.\nOne Message, Different Laws\n67. For every community We appointed a code[668] of life to follow.[669] So\ndo not let them dispute with you ˹O Prophet˺ in this matter. And invite ˹all˺\nto your Lord, for you are truly on the Right Guidance. 68. But if they argue\nwith you, then say, “Allah knows best what you do.” 69. Allah will judge\nbetween you ˹all˺ on Judgment Day regarding your differences. 70. Do you\nnot know that Allah ˹fully˺ knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth?\nSurely it is all ˹written˺ in a Record. That is certainly easy for Allah.\nAlmighty Allah or False Gods?\n71. Yet they worship besides Allah that for which He has sent down no\nauthority, and of which they have no knowledge. The wrongdoers will have\nno helper. 72. Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, you ˹O\nProphet˺ recognize rage on the faces of the disbelievers, as if they are going\nto snap at those who recite Our revelations to them. Say, “Shall I inform\nyou of something far more enraging than that? ˹It is˺ the Fire with which\nAllah has threatened those who disbelieve. What an evil destination!”\nThe Fly Challenge\n73. O humanity! A lesson is set forth, so listen to it ˹carefully˺: those ˹idols˺\nyou invoke besides Allah can never create ˹so much as˺ a fly, even if they\n˹all˺ were to come together for that. And if a fly were to snatch anything\naway from them, they cannot ˹even˺ retrieve it from the fly. How powerless\nare those who invoke and those invoked![670] 74. They have not shown\nAllah the reverence He deserves. Surely Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty.\nDivine Choice\n\n-- 297 of 694 --\n\n75. Allah selects messengers from both angels and people, for Allah is truly\nAll-Hearing, All-Seeing. 76. He knows what is ahead of them and what is\nbehind them. And to Allah ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺.\nAdvice to the Believers\n77. O believers! Bow down, prostrate yourselves, worship your Lord, and\ndo ˹what is˺ good so that you may be successful. 78. Strive for ˹the cause of˺\nAllah in the way He deserves, for ˹it is˺ He ˹Who˺ has chosen you, and laid\nupon you no hardship in the religion—the way of your forefather Abraham.\n˹It is Allah˺ Who named you ‘the ones who submit’[671] ˹in the˺ earlier\n˹Scriptures˺ and in this ˹Quran˺, so that the Messenger may be a witness\nover you, and that you may be witnesses over humanity. So establish prayer,\npay alms-tax, and hold fast to Allah. He ˹alone˺ is your Guardian. What an\nexcellent Guardian, and what an excellent Helper!\n***\n\n-- 298 of 694 --\n\n23. The Believers\n(Al-Mu'minûn)\nThis Meccan sûrah emphasizes that the believers are guaranteed success\n(verse 1), whereas the disbelievers are bound to fail (verse 117). Like the\nprevious sûrah, it makes the case for Allah’s oneness as well as His power\nto create and resurrect. The last part is dedicated to the judgment of the\nbelievers and the disbelievers, focusing on the fate of the wicked who abuse\nthe believers. This theme extends to the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe True Believers\n1. Successful indeed are the believers: 2. those who humble themselves in\nprayer; 3. those who avoid idle talk; 4. those who pay alms-tax;[672] 5. those\nwho guard their chastity[673] 6. except with their wives or those\n˹bondwomen˺ in their possession,[674] for then they are free from blame, 7.\nbut whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors; 8. ˹the believers are\nalso˺ those who are true to their trusts and covenants; 9. and those who are\n˹properly˺ observant of their prayers. 10. These are the ones who will be\nawarded 11. Paradise as their own.[675] They will be there forever.\nThe Creation of Humans\n12. And indeed, We created humankind[676] from an extract of clay, 13. then\nplaced each ˹human˺ as a sperm-drop[677] in a secure place, 14. then We\ndeveloped the drop into a clinging clot ˹of blood˺, then developed the clot\ninto a lump ˹of flesh˺, then developed the lump into bones, then clothed the\nbones with flesh, then We brought it into being as a new creation.[678] So\nBlessed is Allah, the Best of Creators. 15. After that you will surely die, 16.\nthen on the Day of Judgment you will be resurrected.\nAllah’s Power\n17. And indeed, We created above you seven levels ˹of heaven˺. We are\nnever unmindful of ˹Our˺ creation. 18. We send down rain from the sky in\nperfect measure, causing it to soak into the earth. And We are surely able to\ntake it away. 19. With it We produce for you gardens of palm trees and\n\n-- 299 of 694 --\n\ngrapevines, in which there are abundant fruits, and from which you may eat,\n20. as well as ˹olive˺ trees which grow at Mount Sinai, providing oil and a\ncondiment to eat. 21. And there is certainly a lesson for you in cattle, from\nwhose bellies We give you ˹milk˺ to drink, and in them are many other\nbenefits for you, and from them you may eat. 22. And you are carried upon\n˹some of˺ them and upon ships.\nProphet Noah\n23. Indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He declared, “O my people!\nWorship Allah ˹alone˺. You have no god other than Him. Will you not then\nfear ˹Him˺?” 24. But the disbelieving chiefs of his people said ˹to the\nmasses˺, “This is only a human like you, who wants to be superior to you.\nHad Allah willed, He could have easily sent down angels ˹instead˺. We have\nnever heard of this in ˹the history of˺ our forefathers. 25. He is simply\ninsane, so bear with him for a while.”[679]\nThe Flood\n26. Noah prayed, “My Lord! Help me, because they have denied ˹me˺.” 27.\nSo We inspired him: “Build the Ark under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes and\ndirections. Then when Our command comes and the oven bursts ˹with\nwater˺,[680] take on board a pair from every species along with your family\n—except those against whom the decree ˹to drown˺ has already been\npassed. And do not plead with Me for those who have done wrong, for they\nwill surely be drowned.” 28. Then when you and those with you have\nsettled in the Ark, say, “All praise is for Allah, Who saved us from the\nwrongdoing people.” 29. And pray, “My Lord! Allow me a blessed landing,\nfor You are the best accommodator.” 30. Surely in this are lessons.[681] And\nWe ˹always˺ put ˹people˺ to the test.\nProphet Hûd[682]\n31. Then We raised another generation after them, 32. and sent to them a\nmessenger from among themselves, ˹declaring,˺ “Worship Allah ˹alone˺.\nYou have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?” 33. But the\nchiefs of his people—who disbelieved, denied the meeting ˹with Allah˺ in\nthe Hereafter, and were spoiled by the worldly luxuries We had provided for\nthem—said ˹to the masses˺, “This is only a human like you. He eats what\nyou eat, and drinks what you drink. 34. And if you ˹ever˺ obey a human like\n\n-- 300 of 694 --\n\nyourselves, then you would certainly be losers. 35. Does he promise you\nthat once you are dead and reduced to dust and bones, you will be brought\nforth ˹alive˺? 36. Impossible, simply impossible is what you are promised!\n37. There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die, others are born, and\nnone will be resurrected. 38. He is no more than a man who has fabricated a\nlie about Allah, and we will never believe in him.”\nThe Blast\n39. The messenger prayed, “My Lord! Help me, because they have denied\n˹me˺.” 40. Allah responded, “Soon they will be truly regretful.” 41. Then\nthe ˹mighty˺ blast overtook them with justice, and We reduced them to\nrubble. So away with the wrongdoing people!\nMore Prophets\n42. Then We raised other generations after them. 43. No people can\nadvance their doom, nor can they delay it. 44. Then We sent Our\nmessengers in succession: whenever a messenger came to his people, they\ndenied him. So We destroyed them, one after the other, reducing them to\n˹cautionary˺ tales. So away with the people who refuse to believe!\nProphet Moses and Prophet Aaron\n45. Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs[683] and\ncompelling proof 46. to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they behaved arrogantly\nand were a tyrannical people. 47. They argued, “Will we believe in two\nhumans, like ourselves, whose people are slaves to us?” 48. So they rejected\nthem both, and ˹so˺ were among those destroyed. 49. And We certainly gave\nMoses the Scripture, so perhaps his people would be ˹rightly˺ guided.\nProphet Jesus and His Mother\n50. And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them\nrefuge on high ground—a ˹suitable˺ place for rest with flowing water.\nOne Way\n51. O messengers! Eat from what is good and lawful, and act righteously.\nIndeed, I fully know what you do. 52. Surely this religion of yours is ˹only˺\none, and I am your Lord, so fear Me ˹alone˺. 53. Yet the people have\ndivided it into different sects, each rejoicing in what they have. 54. So leave\nthem ˹O Prophet˺ in their heedlessness for a while. 55. Do they think, since\n\n-- 301 of 694 --\n\nWe provide them with wealth and children, 56. that We hasten to ˹honour˺\nthem ˹with˺ all kinds of good? No! They are not aware.\nThe True Believers\n57. Surely those who tremble in awe of their Lord, 58. and who believe in\nthe revelations of their Lord, 59. and who associate none with their Lord,\n60. and who do whatever ˹good˺ they do with their hearts fearful, ˹knowing˺\nthat they will return to their Lord[684]— 61. it is they who race to do good\ndeeds, always taking the lead. 62. We never require of any soul more than\nwhat it can afford. And with Us is a record which speaks the truth. None\nwill be wronged.\nThe Disbelievers\n63. But the hearts of those ˹who disbelieve˺ are oblivious to ˹all of˺ this,[685]\nand they have other ˹evil˺ deeds, opposite to this, in which they are\nengrossed. 64. But as soon as We seize their elite with torment, they start to\ncry for help. 65. ˹They will be told,˺ “Do not cry for help today. Surely you\nwill never be saved from Us. 66. Indeed, My revelations were recited to\nyou, but you used to back away ˹in disgust˺, 67. boasting of the Sacred\nHouse, and babbling ˹nonsense about the Quran˺ by night.”\nWhy the Denial?\n68. Is it because they have never contemplated the Word ˹of Allah˺? Or\n˹because˺ there has come to them something that did not come to their\nforefathers? 69. Or ˹because˺ they failed to recognize their Messenger, and\nso they denied him? 70. Or ˹because˺ they say, “He is insane?” In fact, he\nhas come to them with the truth, but most of them are resentful of the truth.\n71. Had the truth followed their desires,[686] the heavens, the earth, and all\nthose in them would have certainly been corrupted. In fact, We have\nbrought them ˹the means to˺ their glory, but they turn away from it. 72. Or\n˹is it because˺ you ˹O Prophet˺ are asking them for tribute? But the reward\nof your Lord is best, for He is the Best Provider. 73. And surely you are\ncalling them to the Straight Path, 74. but those who disbelieve in the\nHereafter are certainly deviating from that Path.\nThose Persisting in Denial\n75. ˹Even˺ if We had mercy on them and removed their affliction,[687] they\nwould still persist in their transgression, wandering blindly. 76. And We\n\n-- 302 of 694 --\n\nhave already seized them with torment, but they never humbled themselves\nto their Lord, nor did they ˹submissively˺ appeal ˹to Him˺. 77. But as soon\nas We open for them a gate of severe punishment, they will be utterly\ndesperate.\nIngratitude to the Almighty\n78. He is the One Who created for you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺\nyou hardly give any thanks. 79. And He is the One Who has dispersed you\n˹all˺ over the earth, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be gathered. 80. And He is the\nOne Who gives life and causes death, and to Him belongs the alternation of\nthe day and night. Will you not then understand? 81. But they ˹just˺ say\nwhat their predecessors said. 82. They said, “Once we are dead and reduced\nto dust and bones, will we really be resurrected? 83. We have already been\npromised this, as well as our forefathers earlier. This is nothing but ancient\nfables!”\nAlmighty Allah\n84. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “To whom belong the earth and all those on it, if\nyou ˹really˺ know?” 85. They will reply, “To Allah!” Say, “Why are you not\nthen mindful?” 86. ˹And˺ ask ˹them˺, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens\nand the Lord of the Mighty Throne?” 87. They will reply, “Allah.” Say,\n“Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?” 88. Ask ˹them also,˺ “In Whose Hands is\nthe authority over all things, protecting ˹all˺ while none can protect against\nHim, if you ˹really˺ know?” 89. They will reply, “Allah.” Say, “How are\nyou then so deluded?” 90. In fact, We have brought them the truth, and they\nare certainly liars.\nOne True God\n91. Allah has never had ˹any˺ offspring, nor is there any god besides Him.\nOtherwise, each god would have taken away what he created, and they\nwould have tried to dominate one another. Glorified is Allah above what\nthey claim! 92. ˹He is the˺ Knower of the seen and unseen. Exalted is He\nabove what they associate ˹with Him˺.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n93. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord! Should You show me what they[688] are\nthreatened with, 94. then, my Lord, do not count me among the wrongdoing\npeople.” 95. We are indeed able to show you what We have threatened them\n\n-- 303 of 694 --\n\nwith. 96. Respond to evil with what is best. We know well what they claim.\n[689] 97. And say, “My Lord! I seek refuge in You from the temptations of\nthe devils. 98. And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, that they ˹even˺ come\nnear me.”\nToo Late for the Wicked\n99. When death approaches any of them, they cry, “My Lord! Let me go\nback, 100. so I may do good in what I left behind.” Never! It is only a\n˹useless˺ appeal they make. And there is a barrier behind them until the Day\nthey are resurrected.[690]\nJudgment Day\n101. Then, when the Trumpet will be blown,[691] there will be no kinship\nbetween them on that Day, nor will they ˹even care to˺ ask about one\nanother.[692]\nThe Successful Ones\n102. As for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺, it is they who\nwill be successful.\nThe Losers\n103. But those whose scale is light, they will have doomed themselves,\nstaying in Hell forever. 104. The Fire will burn their faces, leaving them\ndeformed. 105. ˹It will be said,˺ “Were My revelations not recited to you,\nbut you used to deny them?” 106. They will cry, “Our Lord! Our ill-fate\ntook hold of us, so we became a misguided people. 107. Our Lord! Take us\nout of this ˹Fire˺. Then if we ever return ˹to denial˺, we will truly be\nwrongdoers.” 108. Allah will respond, “Be despised in there! Do not ˹ever˺\nplead with Me ˹again˺! 109. Indeed, there was a group of My servants who\nused to pray, ‘Our Lord! We have believed, so forgive us and have mercy\non us, for You are the best of those who show mercy,’ 110. but you were ˹so\nbusy˺ making fun of them that it made you forget My remembrance. And\nyou used to laugh at them. 111. Today I have indeed rewarded them for their\nperseverance: they are certainly the triumphant.”\nFleeting World\n112. He will ask ˹them˺, “How many years did you remain on earth?” 113.\nThey will reply, “We remained ˹only˺ a day or part of a day.[693] But ask\nthose who kept count.” 114. He will say, “You only remained for a little\n\n-- 304 of 694 --\n\nwhile, if only you knew. 115. Did you then think that We had created you\nwithout purpose, and that you would never be returned to Us?”\nOne God Only\n116. Exalted is Allah, the True King! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺\nexcept Him, the Lord of the Honourable Throne. 117. Whoever invokes,\nbesides Allah, another god—for which they can have no proof—they will\nsurely find their penalty with their Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will never\nsucceed.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n118. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for You are the\nbest of those who show mercy.”\n***\n\n-- 305 of 694 --\n\n24. The Light\n(An-Nûr)\nThis Medinian sûrah takes its name from the divine light mentioned in\nverses 35-36. A large portion of this sûrah deals with the issue of sexual\nmisconduct hinted at in the previous sûrah (23:7). The sûrah also offers\nsome guidelines to the believers on how they should have reacted to false\nrumours against ’\nȂishah, the Prophet’s wife. Other issues are discussed,\nincluding modesty, entering people’s homes, forced prostitution, hypocrisy,\nand false accusations of adultery. Allah’s power, compliance with His\njudgment, and obedience to the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) are highly emphasized.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Introduction\n1. ˹This is˺ a sûrah which We have revealed and made ˹its rulings˺\nobligatory, and revealed in it clear commandments so that you may be\nmindful.\nPunishment for Fornication\n2. As for female and male fornicators, give each of them one hundred\nlashes,[694] and do not let pity for them make you lenient in ˹enforcing˺ the\nlaw of Allah, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a\nnumber of believers witness their punishment.\nLike for Like\n3. A male fornicator would only marry a female fornicator or idolatress.\nAnd a female fornicator would only be married to a fornicator or idolater.\nThis is ˹all˺ forbidden to the believers.[695]\nUnsupported Accusations\n4. Those who accuse chaste women ˹of adultery˺ and fail to produce four\nwitnesses, give them eighty lashes ˹each˺. And do not ever accept any\ntestimony from them—for they are indeed the rebellious— 5. except those\nwho repent afterwards and mend their ways, then surely Allah is All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\n\n-- 306 of 694 --\n\nAccusation to One’s Wife\n6. And those who accuse their wives ˹of adultery˺ but have no witness\nexcept themselves, the accuser must testify,[696] swearing four times by\nAllah that he is telling the truth, 7. and a fifth oath that Allah may condemn\nhim if he is lying. 8. For her to be spared the punishment, she must swear\nfour times by Allah that he is telling a lie, 9. and a fifth oath that Allah may\nbe displeased with her if he is telling the truth.[697] 10. ˹You would have\nsuffered,˺ had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, and had\nAllah not been Accepting of Repentance, All-Wise.\nThose Who Slandered the Prophet’s Wife[698]\n11. Indeed, those who came up with that ˹outrageous˺ slander are a group of\nyou. Do not think this is bad for you. Rather, it is good for you.[699] They\nwill be punished, each according to their share of the sin. As for their\nmastermind,[700] he will suffer a tremendous punishment.\nHow the Believers Should Have Reacted\n12. If only the believing men and women had thought well of one another,\nwhen you heard this ˹rumour˺, and said, “This is clearly ˹an outrageous˺\nslander!” 13. Why did they not produce four witnesses? Now, since they\nhave failed to produce witnesses, they are ˹truly˺ liars in the sight of Allah.\n14. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you in this world and\nthe Hereafter, you would have certainly been touched with a tremendous\npunishment for what you plunged into— 15. when you passed it from one\ntongue to the other, and said with your mouths what you had no knowledge\nof, taking it lightly while it is ˹extremely˺ serious in the sight of Allah. 16. If\nonly you had said upon hearing it, “How can we speak about such a thing!\nGlory be to You ˹O Lord˺! This is a heinous slander!” 17. Allah forbids you\nfrom ever doing something like this again, if you are ˹true˺ believers. 18.\nAnd Allah makes ˹His˺ commandments clear to you, for Allah is All-\nKnowing, All-Wise.\nWarning to Slanderers\n19. Indeed, those who love to see indecency spread among the believers\nwill suffer a painful punishment in this life and the Hereafter. Allah knows\nand you do not know. 20. ˹You would have suffered,˺ had it not been for\n\n-- 307 of 694 --\n\nAllah’s grace and mercy upon you, and had Allah not been Ever Gracious,\nMost Merciful.\nWarning Against Satan\n21. O believers! Do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Whoever follows\nSatan’s footsteps, then ˹let them know that˺ he surely bids ˹all to˺\nimmorality and wickedness. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy\nupon you, none of you would have ever been purified. But Allah purifies\nwhoever He wills. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\nUninterrupted Kindness\n22. Do not let the people of virtue and affluence among you swear to\nsuspend donations to their relatives, the needy, and the emigrants in the\ncause of Allah. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love to be forgiven\nby Allah? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.[701]\nPunishment of the Slanderers\n23. Surely those who accuse chaste, unsuspecting,[702] believing women are\ncursed in this life and the Hereafter. And they will suffer a tremendous\npunishment 24. on the Day their tongues, hands, and feet will testify against\nthem for what they used to do. 25. On that Day, Allah will give them their\njust penalty in full, and they will ˹come to˺ know that Allah ˹alone˺ is the\nUltimate Truth.\nBirds of a Feather …\n26. Wicked women are for wicked men, and wicked men are for wicked\nwomen. And virtuous women are for virtuous men, and virtuous men are\nfor virtuous women. The virtuous are innocent of what the wicked say.\nThey will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.[703]\nEntering People’s Homes\n27. O believers! Do not enter any house other than your own until you have\nasked for permission and greeted its occupants. This is best for you, so\nperhaps you will be mindful. 28. If you find no one at home, do not enter it\nuntil you have been given permission. And if you are asked to leave, then\nleave. That is purer for you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of what you\ndo.\nEntering Public Places\n\n-- 308 of 694 --\n\n29. There is no blame on you if you enter public places[704] where there is\nsomething of benefit for you. And Allah knows what you reveal and what\nyou conceal.\nAdvice to Muslim Men\n30. ˹O Prophet!˺ Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their\nchastity. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do.\nAdvice to Muslim Women\n31. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their\nchastity, and not to reveal their adornments[705] except what normally\nappears.[706] Let them draw their veils over their chests, and not reveal their\n˹hidden˺ adornments[707] except to their husbands, their fathers, their\nfathers-in-law, their sons, their stepsons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons\nor sisters’ sons, their fellow women, those ˹bondwomen˺ in their\npossession, male attendants with no desire, or children who are still\nunaware of women’s nakedness. Let them not stomp their feet, drawing\nattention to their hidden adornments. Turn to Allah in repentance all\ntogether, O believers, so that you may be successful.\nAdvice to Guardians\n32. Marry off the ˹free˺ singles among you, as well as the righteous of your\nbondmen and bondwomen. If they are poor, Allah will enrich them out of\nHis bounty. For Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing. 33. And let those who\ndo not have the means to marry keep themselves chaste until Allah enriches\nthem out of His bounty. And if any of those ˹bondspeople˺ in your\npossession desires a deed of emancipation,[708] make it possible for them, if\nyou find goodness in them. And give them some of Allah’s wealth which\nHe has granted you. Do not force your ˹slave˺ girls into prostitution for your\nown worldly gains while they wish to remain chaste.[709] And if someone\ncoerces them, then after such a coercion Allah is certainly All-Forgiving,\nMost Merciful ˹to them˺.\nExamples and Lessons\n34. Indeed, We have sent down to you clear revelations, along with\nexamples of those who had gone before you,[710] and a lesson to the God-\nfearing.\nParable for the Believer’s Heart\n\n-- 309 of 694 --\n\n35. Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. His light[711] is like a\nniche in which there is a lamp, the lamp is in a crystal, the crystal is like a\nshining star, lit from ˹the oil of˺ a blessed olive tree, ˹located˺ neither to the\neast nor the west,[712] whose oil would almost glow, even without being\ntouched by fire. Light upon light! Allah guides whoever He wills to His\nlight. And Allah sets forth parables for humanity. For Allah has ˹perfect˺\nknowledge of all things.\nTrue Believers\n36. ˹That light shines˺ through houses ˹of worship˺ which Allah has ordered\nto be raised, and where His Name is mentioned. He is glorified there\nmorning and evening 37. by men[713] who are not distracted—either by\nbuying or selling—from Allah’s remembrance, or performing prayer, or\npaying alms-tax. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will tremble, 38.\n˹hoping˺ that Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds,\nand increase them out of His grace. And Allah provides for whoever He\nwills without limit.\nParable for the Disbelievers\n39. As for the disbelievers, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert, which\nthe thirsty perceive as water, but when they approach it, they find it to be\nnothing. Instead, they find Allah there ˹in the Hereafter, ready˺ to settle their\naccount. And Allah is swift in reckoning.\nAnother Parable\n40. Or ˹their deeds are˺ like the darkness in a deep sea, covered by waves\nupon waves,[714] topped by ˹dark˺ clouds. Darkness upon darkness! If one\nstretches out their hand, they can hardly see it. And whoever Allah does not\nbless with light will have no light!\nSubmission to Allah\n41. Do you not see that Allah is glorified by all those in the heavens and the\nearth, even the birds as they soar? Each ˹instinctively˺ knows their manner\nof prayer and glorification. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all they\ndo. 42. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.\nAnd to Allah is the final return.\nThe Miracle of Rain\n\n-- 310 of 694 --\n\n43. Do you not see that Allah gently drives the clouds, then joins them\ntogether, piling them up into masses, from which you see raindrops come\nforth? And He sends down from the sky mountains ˹of clouds˺ loaded with\nhail, pouring it on whoever He wills and averting it from whoever He wills.\nThe flash of the clouds’ lightning nearly takes away eyesight. 44. Allah\nalternates the day and night. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight.\nThe Miracle of Creation\n45. And Allah has created from water every living creature. Some of them\ncrawl on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. Allah\ncreates whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.\nThe Hypocrites and Judgment\n46. We have indeed sent down revelations clarifying ˹the truth˺. But Allah\n˹only˺ guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path. 47. And the hypocrites\nsay, “We believe in Allah and the Messenger, and we obey.” Then a group\nof them turns away soon after that. These are not ˹true˺ believers. 48. And\nas soon as they are called to Allah and His Messenger so he may judge\nbetween them, a group of them[715] turns away. 49. But if the truth is in\ntheir favour, they come to him, fully submitting. 50. Is there a sickness in\ntheir hearts? Or are they in doubt? Or do they fear that Allah and His\nMessenger will be unjust to them? In fact, it is they who are the ˹true˺\nwrongdoers.\nThe Believers and Judgment\n51. The only response of the ˹true˺ believers, when they are called to Allah\nand His Messenger so he may judge between them, is to say, “We hear and\nobey.” It is they who will ˹truly˺ succeed. 52. For whoever obeys Allah and\nHis Messenger, and fears Allah and is mindful of Him, then it is they who\nwill ˹truly˺ triumph.\nHypocrites’ Lip Service\n53. They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that if you ˹O Prophet˺\nwere to command them, they would certainly march forth ˹in Allah’s cause˺.\nSay, “˹You˺ do not ˹have to˺ swear; your obedience is well known!”[716]\nSurely Allah is All-Aware of what you do.” 54. Say, “Obey Allah and obey\nthe Messenger. But if you turn away, then he is only responsible for his\nduty[717] and you are responsible for yours.[718] And if you obey him, you\n\n-- 311 of 694 --\n\nwill be ˹rightly˺ guided. The Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the\nmessage˺ clearly.”\nAllah’s Promise to the Believers\n55. Allah has promised those of you who believe and do good that He will\ncertainly make them successors in the land, as He did with those before\nthem; and will surely establish for them their faith which He has chosen for\nthem; and will indeed change their fear into security—˹provided that˺ they\nworship Me, associating nothing with Me. But whoever disbelieves after\nthis ˹promise˺, it is they who will be the rebellious. 56. Moreover, establish\nprayer, pay alms-tax, and obey the Messenger, so you may be shown mercy.\n57. Do not think ˹O Prophet˺ that the disbelievers can escape in the land.\nThe Fire will be their home. Indeed, what an evil destination!\nPermission at Three Times\n58. O believers! Let those ˹bondspeople˺ in your possession and those of\nyou who are still under age ask for your permission ˹to come in˺ at three\ntimes: before dawn prayer, when you take off your ˹outer˺ clothes at noon,\nand after the late evening prayer. ˹These are˺ three times of privacy for you.\nOther than these times, there is no blame on you or them to move freely,\nattending to one another. This is how Allah makes the revelations clear to\nyou, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nPermission at All Times\n59. And when your children reach the age of puberty, let them seek\npermission ˹to come in˺, as their seniors do. This is how Allah makes His\nrevelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nModesty for Elderly Women\n60. As for elderly women past the age of marriage, there is no blame on\nthem if they take off their ˹outer˺ garments, without revealing their\nadornments. But it is better for them if they avoid this ˹altogether˺. And\nAllah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\nNo Restrictions\n61. There is no restriction on the blind, or the disabled, or the sick.[719] Nor\non yourselves if you eat from your homes,[720] or the homes of your fathers,\nor your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or your paternal uncles, or\nyour paternal aunts, or your maternal uncles, or your maternal aunts, or\n\n-- 312 of 694 --\n\nfrom the homes in your trust, or ˹the homes of˺ your friends. There is no\nblame on you eating together or separately. However, when you enter\nhouses, greet one another with a greeting ˹of peace˺ from Allah, blessed and\ngood.[721] This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps\nyou will understand.\nSticking with the Prophet\n62. The ˹true˺ believers are only those who believe in Allah and His\nMessenger, and when they are with him on a public matter, they do not\nleave without his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission ˹O\nProphet˺ are the ones who ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and His Messenger. So\nwhen they ask your permission for a private matter, grant permission to\nwhoever you wish and ask Allah’s forgiveness for them. Surely Allah is\nAll-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 63. Do not treat the Messenger’s summons to\nyou ˹as lightly˺ as your summons to one another.[722] Allah certainly knows\nthose of you who slip away, hiding behind others.[723] So let those who\ndisobey his orders beware, for an affliction may befall them, or a painful\ntorment may overtake them.\nAllah Knows Everything\n64. Surely to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. He\nknows well what you stand for. And ˹on˺ the Day all will be returned to\nHim, He will inform them of what they did. For Allah has ˹perfect˺\nknowledge of all things.\n***\n\n-- 313 of 694 --\n\n25. The Standard\n(Al-Furqân)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from verses 1-6, which refute the pagan\nclaims that the Quran was fabricated and plagiarized from earlier\nscriptures. Other passages condemn polytheism, denial of resurrection, and\nmocking the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Allah’s power, manifested in the marvels of\ncreation and rain, is emphasized in this sûrah and the previous one. The\nqualities of the righteous servants of Allah are beautifully laid out in verses\n63-76.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nKingdom of Almighty Allah\n1. Blessed is the One Who sent down the Standard[724] to His servant,[725]\nso that he may be a warner to the whole world.[726] 2. ˹Allah is˺ the One to\nWhom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, Who has never\nhad ˹any˺ offspring, nor does He have a partner in ˹governing˺ the kingdom.\nHe has created everything, ordaining it precisely.\nThe Polytheists\n3. Yet they have taken besides Him gods who cannot create anything but are\nthemselves created. Nor can they protect or benefit themselves. Nor can\nthey control life, death, or resurrection.\nDenying the Quran\n4. The disbelievers say, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but a fabrication which\nhe[727] made up with the help of others.” Their claim is totally unjustified\nand untrue! 5. And they say, “˹These revelations are only˺ ancient fables\nwhich he has had written down, and they are rehearsed to him morning and\nevening.”[728] 6. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “This ˹Quran˺ has been revealed by the\nOne Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth. Surely He is All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.”[729]\nDenying the Prophet\n\n-- 314 of 694 --\n\n7. And they say ˹mockingly˺, “What kind of messenger is this who eats\nfood and goes about in market-places ˹for a living˺? If only an angel had\nbeen sent down with him to be his co-warner, 8. or a treasure had been cast\ndown to him, or he had had a garden from which he may eat!” And the\nwrongdoers say ˹to the believers˺, “You are only following a bewitched\nman.” 9. See ˹O Prophet˺ how they call you names![730] So they have gone\nso ˹far˺ astray that they cannot find the ˹Right˺ Way. 10. Blessed is the One\nWho—if He wills—can give you far better than ˹all˺ that: gardens under\nwhich rivers flow, and palaces as well.\nTorment for the Deniers\n11. In fact, they deny the Hour.[731] And for the deniers of the Hour, We\nhave prepared a blazing Fire. 12. Once it sees them from a distance, they\nwill hear it fuming and growling. 13. And when they are tossed into a\nnarrow place inside ˹Hell˺, chained together, then and there they will cry out\nfor ˹instant˺ destruction. 14. ˹They will be told,˺ “Do not cry only once for\ndestruction, but cry many times over!”\nReward of the Righteous\n15. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Is this better or the Garden of Eternity which the\nrighteous have been promised, as a reward and ˹an ultimate˺ destination?\n16. There they will have whatever they wish for, forever. That is a promise\n˹to be sought after˺, binding on your Lord.”\nThe Disavowal\n17. ˹Watch for˺ the Day He will gather them along with what they used to\nworship besides Allah, and ask ˹the objects of worship˺,[732] “Was it you\nwho misled these servants of Mine, or did they stray from the Way ˹on their\nown˺?” 18. They will say, “Glory be to You! It was not right for ˹others like˺\nus to take any lords besides You,[733] but You allowed enjoyment for them\nand their forefathers ˹for so long˺ that they forgot ˹Your˺ remembrance and\nbecame a doomed people.” 19. ˹The doomed will be told˺, “Your gods have\nclearly denied your claims. So now you can neither ward off ˹the\npunishment˺ nor get any help.” And whoever of you does wrong, We will\nmake them taste a horrible punishment.\nMessengers Are Human\n\n-- 315 of 694 --\n\n20. We never sent any messenger before you ˹O Prophet˺, who did not eat\nfood and go about in market-places. We have made some of you a trial for\nothers. Will you ˹not then˺ be patient? And your Lord is All-Seeing.\nDesperate to Meet the Angels\n21. Those who do not expect to meet Us say, “If only the angels were sent\ndown to us, or we could see our Lord!” They have certainly been carried\naway by their arrogance and have entirely exceeded all limits. 22. ˹But˺ on\nthe Day they will see the angels, there will be no good news for the wicked,\nwho will cry, “Keep away! Away ˹from us˺!”[734] 23. Then We will turn to\nwhatever ˹good˺ deeds they did, reducing them to scattered dust.[735] 24.\n˹But˺ on that Day the residents of Paradise will have the best settlement and\nthe finest place to rest.\nJudgment Day\n25. ˹Watch for˺ the Day the heavens will burst with clouds, and the angels\nwill be sent down in successive ranks. 26. True authority on that Day will\nbelong ˹only˺ to the Most Compassionate.[736] And it will be a hard day for\nthe disbelievers.\nUseless Remorse[737]\n27. And ˹beware of˺ the Day the wrongdoer will bite his nails ˹in regret˺ and\nsay, “Oh! I wish I had followed the Way along with the Messenger! 28.\nWoe to me! I wish I had never taken so-and-so as a close friend. 29. It was\nhe who truly made me stray from the Reminder after it had reached me.”\nAnd Satan has always betrayed humanity.\nPagans’ Neglect of the Quran\n30. The Messenger has cried, “O my Lord! My people have indeed received\nthis Quran with neglect.” 31. Similarly, We made enemies for every prophet\nfrom among the wicked, but sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper.\n32. The disbelievers say, “If only the Quran had been sent down to him all\nat once!” ˹We have sent it˺ as such ˹in stages˺ so We may reassure your\nheart with it. And We have revealed it at a deliberate pace. 33. Whenever\nthey bring you an argument, We come to you with the right refutation and\nthe best explanation. 34. Those who will be dragged into Hell on their faces\nwill be in the worst place, and are ˹now˺ farthest from the ˹Right˺ Way.\nDestruction of Pharaoh’s People\n\n-- 316 of 694 --\n\n35. We certainly gave Moses the Book and appointed his brother Aaron as\nhis helper. 36. We had ordered ˹them˺, “Go to the people who would deny\nOur signs.” Then We annihilated the deniers entirely.\nDestruction of Noah’s People\n37. And when the people of Noah rejected the messengers,[738] We drowned\nthem, making them an example to humanity. And We have prepared a\npainful punishment for the wrongdoers.\nDestruction of Other Peoples\n38. Also ˹We destroyed˺ ’Ȃd, Thamûd, and the people of the Water-pit,[739]\nas well as many peoples in between. 39. For each We set forth ˹various˺\nlessons, and We ultimately destroyed each.\nWarning to Meccan Pagans\n40. They have certainly passed by the city ˹of Sodom˺, which had been\nshowered with a dreadful rain ˹of stones˺. Have they not seen its ruins? But\nthey do not expect to be resurrected. 41. When they see you ˹O Prophet˺,\nthey only make fun of you, ˹saying,˺ “Is this the one that Allah has sent as a\nmessenger? 42. He would have almost tricked us away from our gods, had\nwe not been so devoted to them.” ˹But˺ soon they will know, when they face\nthe punishment, who is far astray from the ˹Right˺ Way. 43. Have you seen\n˹O Prophet˺ the one who has taken their own desires as their god? Will you\nthen be a keeper over them? 44. Or do you think that most of them listen or\nunderstand?[740] They are only like cattle—no, more than that, they are\nastray from the ˹Right˺ Way![741]\nAllah’s Power: 1) The Sun and Shade\n45. Have you not seen how your Lord extends the shade—He could have\nsimply made it ˹remain˺ still if He so willed—then We make the sun its\nguide, 46. causing the shade to retreat gradually?[742]\n2) The Day and Night\n47. He is the One Who has made the night for you as a cover, and ˹made˺\nsleep for resting, and the day for rising.\n3) The Rain\n48. And He is the One Who sends the winds ushering in His mercy, and We\nsend down pure rain from the sky, 49. giving life to a lifeless land, and\n\n-- 317 of 694 --\n\nproviding water for countless animals and humans of Our Own creation. 50.\nWe certainly disperse it among them so they may be mindful, but most\npeople persist in ungratefulness.\nOne Universal Messenger\n51. Had We willed, We could have easily sent a warner to every society. 52.\nSo do not yield to the disbelievers, but strive diligently against them with\nthis ˹Quran˺.\n4) Fresh and Salt Water\n53. And He is the One Who merges the two bodies of water: one fresh and\npalatable and the other salty and bitter, placing between them a barrier they\ncannot cross.[743]\n5) Creation of Humans\n54. And He is the One Who creates human beings from a ˹humble˺ liquid,\n[744] then establishes for them bonds of kinship and marriage. For your Lord\nis Most Capable.\nPowerless Gods\n55. Yet they worship besides Allah what can neither benefit nor harm them.\nAnd the disbeliever always collaborates against their Lord.\nAdvice to the Prophet: Trust in Allah\n56. And We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a deliverer of good news and\na warner. 57. Say, “I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹message˺, but\nwhoever wishes, let them pursue the Way to their Lord.” 58. Put your trust\nin the Ever-Living, Who never dies, and glorify His praises. Sufficient is He\nas All-Aware of the sins of His servants. 59. ˹He is˺ the One Who created\nthe heavens and the earth and everything in between in six Days,[745] then\nestablished Himself on the Throne. ˹He is˺ the Most Compassionate! Ask\n˹none other than˺ the All-Knowledgeable about Himself.\nDenying Allah\n60. When it is said to them, “Prostrate to the Most Compassionate,” they\nask ˹in disgust˺, “What is ‘the Most Compassionate’? Will we prostrate to\nwhatever you order us to?” And it only drives them farther away.\nAllah Almighty\n\n-- 318 of 694 --\n\n61. Blessed is the One Who has placed constellations in the sky, as well as a\n˹radiant˺ lamp[746] and a luminous moon. 62. And He is the One Who\ncauses the day and the night to alternate, ˹as a sign˺ for whoever desires to\nbe mindful or to be grateful.\nQualities of the Righteous: 1) Humility\n63. The ˹true˺ servants of the Most Compassionate are those who walk on\nthe earth humbly, and when the foolish address them ˹improperly˺, they\nonly respond with peace.\n2) Sincere Devotion\n64. ˹They are˺ those who spend ˹a good portion of˺ the night, prostrating\nthemselves and standing before their Lord.\n3)\n˹Hope and\n˺ Fear\n65. ˹They are˺ those who pray, “Our Lord! Keep the punishment of Hell\naway from us, for its punishment is indeed unrelenting. 66. It is certainly an\nevil place to settle and reside.”\n4) Moderate Spending\n67. ˹They are˺ those who spend neither wastefully nor stingily, but\nmoderately in between.\n5) Avoiding Major Sins\n68. ˹They are˺ those who do not invoke any other god besides Allah, nor\ntake a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right,[747]\nnor commit fornication. And whoever does ˹any of˺ this will face the\npenalty. 69. Their punishment will be multiplied on the Day of Judgment,\nand they will remain in it forever, in disgrace. 70. As for those who repent,\nbelieve, and do good deeds, they are the ones whose evil deeds Allah will\nchange into good deeds. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 71. And\nwhoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah properly.\n6) Avoiding Falsehood\n72. ˹They are˺ those who do not bear false witness, and when they come\nacross falsehood, they pass ˹it˺ by with dignity.\n7) Full Submission\n73. ˹They are˺ those who, when reminded of the revelation of their Lord, do\nnot turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to it.\n\n-- 319 of 694 --\n\n8) Righteous Company\n74. ˹They are˺ those who pray, “Our Lord! Bless us with ˹pious˺ spouses\nand offspring who will be the joy of our hearts, and make us models for the\nrighteous.”\nReward of the Righteous\n75. It is they who will be rewarded with ˹elevated˺ mansions ˹in Paradise˺\nfor their perseverance, and will be received with salutations and ˹greetings\nof˺ peace, 76. staying there forever. What an excellent place to settle and\nreside!\nCall to Humanity\n77. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “You ˹all˺ would not ˹even˺ matter to my Lord were it\nnot for your faith ˹in Him˺. But now you ˹disbelievers˺ have denied ˹the\ntruth˺, so the torment is bound to come.”\n***\n\n-- 320 of 694 --\n\n26. The Poets\n(Ash-Shu’arâ')\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the reference to poets in verses 224-\n226. Since the previous sûrah ends with a warning to the deniers of the\ntruth, this sûrah recounts several cautionary tales of destroyed deniers such\nas Pharaoh and the peoples of Noah, Shu’aib, Lot, and\nṢâli\nḥ. The divine\norigin of the Quran is emphasized at both ends of the sûrah. The qualities of\nthe believers mentioned in the last verse (227) are elaborated upon at the\nbeginning of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n1.\nṬâ-Sĩn-Mĩm. 2. These are the verses of the clear Book. 3. Perhaps you ˹O\nProphet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their disbelief. 4. If We willed,\nWe could send down upon them a ˹compelling˺ sign from the heavens,\nleaving their necks bent in ˹utter˺ submission to it. 5. Whatever new\nreminder comes to them from the Most Compassionate, they always turn\naway from it. 6. They have certainly denied ˹the truth˺, so they will soon\nface the consequences of their ridicule. 7. Have they failed to look at the\nearth, ˹to see˺ how many types of fine plants We have caused to grow in it?\n8. Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. 9. And your\nLord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful.\nProphet Moses\n10. ˹Remember˺ when your Lord called out to Moses, “Go to the\nwrongdoing people— 11. the people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear\n˹Allah˺?” 12. He replied, “My Lord! I fear that they will reject me. 13. And\n˹so˺ my heart will be broken and my tongue will be tied. So send Aaron\nalong ˹as a messenger˺. 14. Also, they have a charge against me,[748] so I\nfear they may kill me.” 15. Allah responded, “Certainly not! So go, both of\nyou, with Our signs. We will be with you, listening. 16. Go to Pharaoh and\nsay, ‘We are messengers from the Lord of all worlds, 17. ˹commanded to\nsay:˺ ‘Let the Children of Israel go with us.’’”\n\n-- 321 of 694 --\n\nMoses vs. Pharaoh\n18. Pharaoh protested, “Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you\nstayed several years of your life in our care? 19. Then you did what you did,\n[749] being ˹utterly˺ ungrateful!” 20. Moses replied, “I did it then, lacking\nguidance. 21. So I fled from you when I feared you. Then my Lord granted\nme wisdom and made me one of the messengers. 22. How can that be a\n‘favour,’ of which you remind me, when ˹it was only because˺ you ˹have˺\nenslaved the Children of Israel?” 23. Pharaoh asked, “And what is ‘the Lord\nof all worlds’?” 24. Moses replied, “˹He is˺ the Lord of the heavens and the\nearth and everything in between, if only you had sure faith.” 25. Pharaoh\nsaid to those around him, “Did you hear ˹what he said˺?” 26. Moses added,\n“˹He is˺ your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.” 27. Pharaoh said\n˹mockingly˺, “Your messenger, who has been sent to you, must be insane.”\n28. Moses responded: “˹He is˺ the Lord of the east and west, and everything\nin between, if only you had any sense.”\nThe Challenge\n29. Pharaoh threatened, “If you take any other god besides me, I will\ncertainly have you imprisoned.” 30. Moses responded, “Even if I bring you\na clear proof?” 31. Pharaoh demanded, “Bring it then, if what you say is\ntrue.” 32. So he threw down his staff and—behold!—it became a real snake.\n33. Then he drew his hand ˹out of his collar˺ and it was ˹shining˺ white for\nall to see. 34. Pharaoh said to the chiefs around him, “He is indeed a skilled\nmagician, 35. who seeks to drive you from your land by his magic. So what\ndo you propose?” 36. They replied, “Let him and his brother wait and\ndispatch mobilizers to all cities 37. to bring you every skilled magician.”\n38. So the magicians were assembled at the set time on the appointed day.\n39. And the people were asked, “Will you join the gathering, 40. so that we\nmay follow the magicians if they prevail?”\nMoses and the Magicians Face off\n41. When the magicians came, they asked Pharaoh, “Shall we have a\n˹suitable˺ reward if we prevail?” 42. He replied, “Yes, and you will then\ncertainly be among those closest to me.” 43. Moses said to them, “Cast\nwhatever you wish to cast.” 44. So they cast down their ropes and staffs,\nsaying, “By Pharaoh’s might, it is we who will surely prevail.” 45. Then\n\n-- 322 of 694 --\n\nMoses threw down his staff, and—behold!—it devoured the objects of their\nillusion!\nMagicians Become Believers\n46. So the magicians fell down, prostrating. 47. They declared, “We ˹now˺\nbelieve in the Lord of all worlds— 48. the Lord of Moses and Aaron.” 49.\nPharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you\npermission? He must be your master who taught you magic, but soon you\nwill see. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then\ncrucify you all.” 50. They responded, “˹That would be˺ no harm! Surely to\nour Lord we will ˹all˺ return. 51. We really hope that our Lord will forgive\nour sins, as we are the first to believe.”\nPharaoh Chases the Israelites\n52. And We inspired Moses, ˹saying,˺ “Leave with My servants at night, for\nyou will surely be pursued.” 53. Then Pharaoh sent mobilizers to all cities,\n54. ˹and said,˺ “These ˹outcasts˺ are just a handful of people, 55. who have\nreally enraged us, 56. but we are all on the alert.” 57. So We lured the\ntyrants[750] out of ˹their˺ gardens, springs, 58. treasures, and splendid\nresidences. 59. So it was. And We awarded it ˹all˺ to the Children of Israel.\nThe End of Pharaoh\n60. And so they pursued them at sunrise. 61. When the two groups came\nface to face, the companions of Moses cried out, “We are overtaken for\nsure.” 62. Moses reassured ˹them˺, “Absolutely not! My Lord is certainly\nwith me—He will guide me.” 63. So We inspired Moses: “Strike the sea\nwith your staff,” and the sea was split, each part was like a huge mountain.\n64. We drew the pursuers to that place, 65. and delivered Moses and those\nwith him all together. 66. Then We drowned the others. 67. Surely in this is\na sign. Yet most of them would not believe. 68. And your Lord is certainly\nthe Almighty, Most Merciful.\nProphet Abraham\n69. Relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of Abraham, 70. when he\nquestioned his father and his people, “What is that you worship ˹besides\nAllah˺?” 71. They replied, “We worship idols, to which we are fully\ndevoted.” 72. Abraham asked, “Can they hear you when you call upon\nthem? 73. Or can they benefit or harm you?” 74. They replied, “No! But we\n\n-- 323 of 694 --\n\nfound our forefathers doing the same.” 75. Abraham responded, “Have you\n˹really˺ considered what you have been worshipping— 76. you and your\nancestors? 77. They are ˹all˺ enemies to me, except the Lord of all worlds.\n78. ˹He is˺ the One Who created me, and He ˹alone˺ guides me. 79. ˹He is˺\nthe One Who provides me with food and drink. 80. And He ˹alone˺ heals\nme when I am sick. 81. And He ˹is the One Who˺ will cause me to die, and\nthen bring me back to life. 82. And He is ˹the One˺ Who, I hope, will\nforgive my flaws[751] on Judgment Day.”\nAbraham’s Prayer\n83. “My Lord! Grant me wisdom, and join me with the righteous. 84. Bless\nme with honourable mention among later generations.[752] 85. Make me one\nof those awarded the Garden of Bliss. 86. Forgive my father, for he is\ncertainly one of the misguided. 87. And do not disgrace me on the Day all\nwill be resurrected— 88. the Day when neither wealth nor children will be\nof any benefit. 89. Only those who come before Allah with a pure heart\n˹will be saved˺.”[753]\nJudgment Day\n90. ˹On that Day˺ Paradise will be brought near to the God-fearing, 91. and\nthe Hellfire will be displayed to the deviant. 92. And it will be said to them,\n“Where are those you used to worship 93. besides Allah? Can they help you\nor even help themselves?” 94. Then the idols will be hurled headlong into\nHell, along with the deviant 95. and the soldiers of Iblîs,[754] all together.\n96. There the deviant will cry while disputing with their idols, 97. “By\nAllah! We were clearly mistaken, 98. when we made you equal to the Lord\nof all worlds. 99. And none led us astray other than the wicked. 100. Now\nwe have none to intercede for us, 101. nor a close friend. 102. If only we\ncould have a second chance, then we would be believers.” 103. Surely in\nthis is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. 104. And your Lord is\ncertainly the Almighty, Most Merciful.\nProphet Noah\n105. The people of Noah rejected the messengers[755] 106. when their\nbrother Noah said to them, “Will you not fear ˹Allah˺? 107. I am truly a\ntrustworthy messenger to you. 108. So fear Allah, and obey me. 109. I do\nnot ask you for any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the\n\n-- 324 of 694 --\n\nLord of all worlds. 110. So fear Allah, and obey me.” 111. They argued,\n“How can we believe in you, when you are followed ˹only˺ by the lowest of\nthe low?”[756] 112. He responded, “And what knowledge do I have of what\nthey do? 113. Their judgment is with my Lord, if you had any sense! 114. I\nam not going to expel the believers. 115. I am only sent with a clear\nwarning.”\nNoah’s People Destroyed\n116. They threatened, “If you do not desist, O Noah, you will surely be\nstoned ˹to death˺.” 117. Noah prayed, “My Lord! My people have truly\nrejected me. 118. So judge between me and them decisively, and save me\nand the believers with me.” 119. So We saved him and those with him in the\nfully loaded Ark. 120. Then afterwards We drowned the rest. 121. Surely in\nthis is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. 122. And your Lord is\ncertainly the Almighty, Most Merciful.\nProphet Hûd\n123. The people of ’Âd rejected the messengers 124. when their brother\nHûd said to them, “Will you not fear ˹Allah˺? 125. I am truly a trustworthy\nmessenger to you. 126. So fear Allah, and obey me. 127. I do not ask you\nfor any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the Lord of all\nworlds. 128. ˹Why˺ do you build a landmark on every high place in vanity,\n129. and construct castles, as if you are going to live forever, 130. and act\nso viciously when you attack ˹others˺? 131. So fear Allah, and obey me.\n132. Fear the One Who has provided you with ˹the good˺ things you know:\n133. He provided you with cattle, and children, 134. and gardens, and\nsprings. 135. I truly fear for you the torment of a tremendous day.”\nHûd’s People Destroyed\n136. They responded, “It is all the same to us whether you warn ˹us˺ or not.\n137. This is simply the tradition of our predecessors. 138. And we will\nnever be punished.” 139. So they rejected him, and ˹so˺ We destroyed them.\nSurely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. 140. And your\nLord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful.\nProphet\nṢâli\nḥ\n141. The people of Thamûd rejected the messengers 142. when their brother\nṢâliḥ said to them, “Will you not fear ˹Allah˺? 143. I am truly a trustworthy\n\n-- 325 of 694 --\n\nmessenger to you. 144. So fear Allah, and obey me. 145. I do not ask you\nfor any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the Lord of all\nworlds. 146. Do you think you will be ˹forever˺ left secure in what you have\nhere: 147. amid gardens and springs, 148. and ˹various˺ crops, and palm\ntrees ˹loaded˺ with tender fruit; 149. to carve homes in the mountains with\ngreat skill? 150. So fear Allah, and obey me. 151. And do not follow the\ncommand of the transgressors, 152. who spread corruption throughout the\nland, never setting things right.”\nṢâli\nḥ’s People Destroyed\n153. They replied, “You are simply bewitched! 154. You are only a human\nbeing like us, so bring forth a sign if what you say is true.” 155. Ṣâliḥ said,\n“Here is a camel. She will have her turn to drink as you have yours, each on\nan appointed day. 156. And do not ever touch her with harm, or you will be\novertaken by the torment of a tremendous day.” 157. But they killed her,\nbecoming regretful. 158. So the punishment overtook them. Surely in this is\na sign. Yet most of them would not believe. 159. And your Lord is certainly\nthe Almighty, Most Merciful.\nProphet Lot\n160. The people of Lot rejected the messengers 161. when their brother Lot\nsaid to them, “Will you not fear ˹Allah˺? 162. I am truly a trustworthy\nmessenger to you. 163. So fear Allah, and obey me. 164. I do not ask you\nfor any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the Lord of all\nworlds. 165. Why do you ˹men˺ lust after fellow men,[757] 166. leaving the\nwives that your Lord has created for you? In fact, you are a transgressing\npeople.”\nLot’s People Destroyed\n167. They threatened, “If you do not desist, O Lot, you will surely be\nexpelled.” 168. Lot responded, “I am truly one of those who despise your\n˹shameful˺ practice. 169. My Lord! Save me and my family from ˹the\nconsequences of˺ what they do.” 170. So We saved him and all of his\nfamily, 171. except an old woman,[758] who was one of the doomed. 172.\nThen We utterly destroyed the rest, 173. pouring upon them a rain ˹of\nbrimstone˺. How evil was the rain of those who had been warned! 174.\n\n-- 326 of 694 --\n\nSurely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. 175. And your\nLord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful.\nProphet Shu’aib\n176. The residents of the Forest rejected the messengers 177. when Shu’aib\nsaid to them,[759] “Will you not fear ˹Allah˺? 178. I am truly a trustworthy\nmessenger to you. 179. So fear Allah, and obey me. 180. I do not ask you\nfor any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the Lord of all\nworlds. 181. Give full measure, and cause no loss ˹to others˺. 182. Weigh\nwith an even balance, 183. and do not defraud people of their property. Nor\ngo about spreading corruption in the land. 184. And fear the One Who\ncreated you and ˹all˺ earlier peoples.”\nShu’aib’s People Destroyed\n185. They replied, “You are simply bewitched! 186. Also, you are only a\nhuman being like us, and we think you are indeed a liar. 187. So cause\n˹deadly˺ pieces of the sky to fall upon us, if what you say is true.” 188.\nShu’aib responded, “My Lord knows best whatever you do.” 189. So they\nrejected him, and ˹so˺ were overtaken by the torment of the day of the\n˹deadly˺ cloud.[760] That was really a torment of a tremendous day. 190.\nSurely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. 191. And your\nLord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful.\nThe Quran\n192. This is certainly a revelation from the Lord of all worlds, 193. which\nthe trustworthy spirit ˹Gabriel˺ brought down 194. into your heart ˹O\nProphet˺—so that you may be one of the warners— 195. in a clear Arabic\ntongue. 196. And it has indeed been ˹foretold˺ in the Scriptures of those\nbefore. 197. Was it not sufficient proof for the deniers that it has been\nrecognized by the knowledgeable among the Children of Israel?[761] 198.\nHad We revealed it to a non-Arab, 199. who would then recite it to the\ndeniers ˹in fluent Arabic˺, still they would not have believed in it! 200. This\nis how We allow denial ˹to steep˺ into the hearts of the wicked. 201. They\nwill not believe in it until they see the painful punishment, 202. which will\ntake them by surprise when they least expect ˹it˺. 203. Then they will cry,\n“Can we be allowed more time?”\nWarning to the Meccan Pagans\n\n-- 327 of 694 --\n\n204. Do they ˹really˺ seek to hasten Our torment? 205. Imagine ˹O Prophet˺\nif We allowed them enjoyment for years, 206. then there came to them what\nthey had been threatened with: 207. would that enjoyment be of any benefit\nto them ˹at all˺? 208. We have never destroyed a society without warners\n209. to remind ˹them˺, for We would never wrong ˹anyone˺.\nThe Quran Is Allah’s Word\n210. It was not the devils who brought this ˹Quran˺ down: 211. it is not for\nthem ˹to do so˺, nor can they, 212. for they are strictly barred from ˹even˺\noverhearing ˹it˺.[762]\nAdvice to the Prophet\n213. So do not ever call upon any other god besides Allah, or you will be\none of the punished. 214. And warn ˹all, starting with˺ your closest\nrelatives, 215. and be gracious to the believers who follow you. 216. But if\nthey disobey you, say, “I am certainly free of what you do.” 217. Put your\ntrust in the Almighty, Most Merciful, 218. Who sees you when you rise ˹for\nprayer at night˺, 219. as well as your movements ˹in prayer˺ along with\n˹fellow˺ worshippers. 220. He ˹alone˺ is indeed the All-Hearing, All-\nKnowing.\nThe Devils\n221. Shall I inform you of whom the devils ˹actually˺ descend upon? 222.\nThey descend upon every sinful liar, 223. who gives an ˹attentive˺ ear ˹to\nhalf-truths˺, mostly passing on sheer lies.[763]\nThe Poets\n224. As for poets, they are followed ˹merely˺ by deviants. 225. Do you not\nsee how they rant in every field,[764] 226. only saying what they never do?\n227. Except those who believe, do good, remember Allah often, and\n˹poetically˺ avenge ˹the believers˺ after being wrongfully slandered. The\nwrongdoers will come to know what ˹evil˺ end they will meet.\n***\n\n-- 328 of 694 --\n\n27. The Ants\n(An-Naml)\nThis Meccan sûrah narrates the encounters of Solomon (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) with ants\n(hence the sûrah’s name), a hoopoe, and the Queen of Sheba—which do not\nappear in any other sûrah. Allah’s power to create and provide is\ncontrasted with the powerlessness of the idols. Some deterring examples are\ngiven to the pagans, along with a warning of the horrors of the apocalypse.\nThe Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reassured of the truth of the Quran and told that\nhis duty is only to deliver the message. Judgment rests with Allah alone.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nQualities of the Believers\n1.\nṬâ-Sĩn. These are the verses of the Quran; the clear Book. 2. ˹It is˺ a\nguide and good news for the believers: 3. ˹those˺ who establish prayer, pay\nalms-tax, and have sure faith in the Hereafter.\nQualities of the Disbelievers\n4. As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have certainly made\ntheir ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, so they wander blindly. 5. It is they\nwho will suffer a dreadful torment, and in the Hereafter they will ˹truly˺ be\nthe greatest losers. 6. And indeed, you ˹O Prophet˺ are receiving the Quran\nfrom the One ˹Who is˺ All-Wise, All-Knowing.\nMoses and the Nine Signs\n7. ˹Remember˺ when Moses said to his family, “I have spotted a fire. I will\neither bring you some directions[765] from there, or a burning torch so you\nmay warm yourselves.” 8. But when he came to it, he was called ˹by Allah˺,\n“Blessed is the one at the fire, and whoever is around it![766] Glory be to\nAllah, the Lord of all worlds. 9. O Moses! It is truly I. I am Allah—the\nAlmighty, All-Wise. 10. Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it\nslithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. ˹Allah reassured\nhim,˺ “O Moses! Do not be afraid! Messengers should have no fear in My\npresence. 11. ˹Fear is˺ only for those who do wrong. But if they later mend\n˹their˺ evil ˹ways˺ with good, then I am certainly All-Forgiving, Most\n\n-- 329 of 694 --\n\nMerciful. 12. Now put your hand through ˹the opening of˺ your collar, it\nwill come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished.[767] ˹These are two˺ of nine\nsigns for Pharaoh and his people.[768] They have truly been a rebellious\npeople.” 13. But when Our enlightening signs came to them, they said,\n“This is pure magic.” 14. And, although their hearts were convinced the\nsigns were true, they still denied them wrongfully and arrogantly. See then\nwhat was the end of the corruptors!\nDavid and Solomon\n15. Indeed, We granted knowledge to David and Solomon. And they said\n˹in acknowledgment˺, “All praise is for Allah Who has privileged us over\nmany of His faithful servants.”[769] 16. And David was succeeded by\nSolomon, who said, “O people! We have been taught the language of birds,\nand been given everything ˹we need˺. This is indeed a great privilege.”\nSolomon and the Ant\n17. Solomon’s forces of jinn, humans, and birds were rallied for him,\nperfectly organized. 18. And when they came across a valley of ants, an ant\nwarned, “O ants! Go quickly into your homes so Solomon and his armies\ndo not crush you, unknowingly.” 19. So Solomon smiled in amusement at\nher words, and prayed, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for\nYour favours which You have blessed me and my parents with, and to do\ngood deeds that please you. Admit me, by Your mercy, into ˹the company\nof˺ Your righteous servants.”\nSolomon and the Hoopoe\n20. ˹One day˺ he inspected the birds, and wondered, “Why is it that I cannot\nsee the hoopoe? Or could he be absent? 21. I will surely subject him to a\nsevere punishment, or ˹even˺ slaughter him, unless he brings me a\ncompelling excuse.” 22. It was not long before the bird came and said, “I\nhave found out something you do not know. I have just come to you from\nSheba with sure news. 23. Indeed, I found a woman ruling over them,[770]\nwho has been given everything ˹she needs˺, and who has a magnificent\nthrone. 24. I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of\nAllah. For Satan has made their deeds appealing to them—hindering them\nfrom the ˹Right˺ Way and leaving them unguided— 25. so they do not\nprostrate to Allah, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the\n\n-- 330 of 694 --\n\nearth, and knows what you ˹all˺ conceal and what you reveal. 26. ˹He is˺\nAllah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Lord of the\nMighty Throne.”\nSolomon’s Letter\n27. Solomon said, “We will see whether you are telling the truth or lying.\n28. Go with this letter of mine and deliver it to them, then stand aside and\nsee how they will respond.” 29. The Queen ˹later˺ announced, “O chiefs!\nIndeed, a noble letter has been delivered to me. 30. It is from Solomon, and\nit reads: ‘In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.\n31. Do not be arrogant with me, but come to me, fully submitting ˹to\nAllah˺.’”\nThe Queen’s Response\n32. She said, “O chiefs! Advise me in this matter of mine, for I would never\nmake any decision without you.” 33. They responded, “We are a people of\nstrength and great ˹military˺ might, but the decision is yours, so decide what\nyou will command.” 34. She reasoned, “Indeed, when kings invade a land,\nthey ruin it and debase its nobles. They really do so! 35. But I will certainly\nsend him a gift, and see what ˹response˺ my envoys will return with.”[771]\nSolomon’s Response\n36. When the chief-envoy came to him, Solomon said, “Do you offer me\nwealth? What Allah has granted me is far greater than what He has granted\nyou. No! It is you who rejoice in ˹receiving˺ gifts. 37. Go back to them, for\nwe will certainly mobilize against them forces which they can never resist,\nand we will drive them out from there in disgrace, fully humbled.”[772]\nThe Queen’s Throne\n38. Solomon asked, “O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne\nbefore they come to me in ˹full˺ submission?”[773] 39. One mighty jinn\nresponded, “I can bring it to you before you rise from this council of yours.\nAnd I am quite strong and trustworthy for this ˹task˺.” 40. But the one who\nhad knowledge of the Scripture said,[774] “I can bring it to you in the blink\nof an eye.” So when Solomon saw it placed before him, he exclaimed,\n“This is by the grace of my Lord to test me whether I am grateful or\nungrateful. And whoever is grateful, it is only for their own good. But\nwhoever is ungrateful, surely my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.”\n\n-- 331 of 694 --\n\n41. ˹Then˺ Solomon said, “Disguise her throne for her so we may see\nwhether she will recognize ˹it˺ or she will not be able to.” 42. So when she\narrived, it was said ˹to her˺, “Is your throne like this?” She replied, “It looks\nto be the same. We have ˹already˺ received knowledge ˹of Solomon’s\nprophethood˺[775] before this ˹miracle˺,[776] and have submitted ˹to Allah˺.”\n43. But she had been hindered by what she used to worship instead of\nAllah, for she was indeed from a disbelieving people.\nSolomon’s Palace\n44. Then she was told, “Enter the palace.” But when she saw the hall, she\nthought it was a body of water, so she bared her legs. Solomon said. “It is\njust a palace paved with crystal.” ˹At last˺ she declared, “My Lord! I have\ncertainly wronged my soul. Now I ˹fully˺ submit myself along with\nSolomon to Allah, the Lord of all worlds.”\nProphet\nṢâli\nḥ and His People\n45. And We certainly sent to the people of Thamûd their brother Ṣâliḥ,\nproclaiming, “Worship Allah,” but they suddenly split into two opposing\ngroups.[777] 46. He urged ˹the disbelieving group˺, “O my people! Why do\nyou ˹seek to˺ hasten the torment[778] rather than grace?[779] If only you\nsought Allah’s forgiveness so you may be shown mercy!” 47. They replied,\n“You and your followers are a bad omen for us.”[780] He responded, “Your\nomens are destined by Allah. In fact, you are ˹only˺ a people being tested.”\nAn Attempt on\nṢâli\nḥ’s Life\n48. And there were in the city nine ˹elite˺ men who spread corruption in the\nland, never doing what is right. 49. They vowed, “Let us swear by Allah\nthat we will take him and his family down by night. Then we will certainly\nsay to his ˹closest˺ heirs, ‘We did not witness the murder of his family. We\nare definitely telling the truth.’” 50. And ˹so˺ they made a plan, but We too\nmade a plan, while they were unaware. 51. See then what the consequences\nof their plan were: We ˹utterly˺ destroyed them and their people all together.\n52. So their homes are there, ˹but completely˺ ruined because of their\nwrongdoing. Surely in this is a lesson for people of knowledge. 53. And We\ndelivered those who were faithful and were mindful ˹of Allah˺.\nProphet Lot and His People\n\n-- 332 of 694 --\n\n54. And ˹remember˺ Lot, when he rebuked ˹the men of˺ his people, “Do you\ncommit that shameful deed while you can see ˹one another˺? 55. Do you\nreally lust after men instead of women? In fact, you are ˹only˺ a people\nacting ignorantly.” 56. But his people’s only response was to say, “Expel\nLot’s followers from your land! They are a people who wish to remain\nchaste!” 57. So We delivered him and his family, except his wife. We had\ndestined her to be one of the doomed. 58. And We poured upon them a rain\n˹of brimstone˺. How evil was the rain of those who had been warned!\nQuestions to the Pagans:1) Who Is the Creator?\n59. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Praise be to Allah, and peace be upon the servants He\nhas chosen.” ˹Ask the disbelievers,˺ “Which is better: Allah or whatever\n˹gods˺ they associate ˹with Him˺?” 60. Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who created the\nheavens and the earth, and sends down rain for you from the sky, by which\nWe cause delightful gardens to grow? You could never cause their trees to\ngrow. Was it another god besides Allah?” Absolutely not! But they are a\npeople who set up equals ˹to Allah˺! 61. Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who made the\nearth a place of settlement, caused rivers to flow through it, placed firm\nmountains upon it, and set a barrier between ˹fresh and salt˺ bodies of\nwater?[781] Was it another god besides Allah?” Absolutely not! But most of\nthem do not know.\n2) Who Is the Most Gracious?\n62. Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who responds to the distressed when they cry to Him,\nrelieving ˹their˺ affliction, and ˹Who˺ makes you successors in the earth? Is\nit another god besides Allah? Yet you are hardly mindful!” 63. Or ˹ask\nthem,˺ “Who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea,[782] and sends\nthe winds ushering in His mercy?[783] Is it another god besides Allah?\nExalted is Allah above what they associate ˹with Him˺! 64. Or ˹ask them,˺\n“Who originates the creation then resurrects it, and gives you provisions\nfrom the heavens and the earth? Is it another god besides Allah?” Say, ˹O\nProphet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof, if what you say is true.”\nOnly Allah Knows the Unseen[784]\n65. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “None in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of\nthe unseen except Allah. Nor do they know when they will be resurrected.”\n\n-- 333 of 694 --\n\n66. No! Their knowledge of the Hereafter amounts to ignorance. In fact,\nthey are in doubt about it. In truth, they are ˹totally˺ blind to it.\nDenying Resurrection\n67. The disbelievers ask, “When we and our fathers are reduced to dust,\nwill we really be brought forth ˹alive˺? 68. We have already been promised\nthis, as well as our forefathers earlier. This is nothing but ancient fables!”\n69. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Travel throughout the land and see the fate of the\nwicked.” 70. Do not grieve for them, nor be distressed by their schemes.\nRidiculing Punishment\n71. They ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what\nyou say is true?” 72. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Perhaps some of what you seek to\nhasten is close at hand.” 73. Surely your Lord is ever Bountiful to humanity,\n[785] but most of them are ungrateful. 74. And surely your Lord knows what\ntheir hearts conceal and what they reveal.[786] 75. For there is nothing\nhidden in the heavens or the earth without being ˹written˺ in a perfect\nRecord.[787]\nAdvice to the Prophet\n76. Indeed, this Quran clarifies for the Children of Israel most of what they\ndiffer over. 77. And it is truly a guide and mercy for the believers. 78. Your\nLord will certainly judge between them by His justice, for He is the\nAlmighty, All-Knowing. 79. So put your trust in Allah, for you are surely\nupon the ˹Path of˺ clear truth. 80. You certainly cannot make the dead hear\n˹the truth˺. Nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their\nbacks and walk away. 81. Nor can you lead the blind out of their\nmisguidance. You can make none hear ˹the truth˺ except those who believe\nin Our revelations, ˹fully˺ submitting ˹to Allah˺.\nThe Apocalypse\n82. And when the decree ˹of the Hour˺ comes to pass against them, We will\nbring forth for them a beast from the earth,[788] telling them that the people\nhad no sure faith in Our revelations. 83. ˹Watch for˺ the Day We will gather\nfrom every faith-community a group of those who denied Our revelations,\nand they will be driven in ranks. 84. When they ˹finally˺ come before their\nLord, He will ask ˹them˺, “Did you deny My revelations without ˹even˺\ncomprehending them? Or what ˹exactly˺ did you do?” 85. And the decree\n\n-- 334 of 694 --\n\n˹of torment˺ will be justified against them for their wrongdoing, leaving\nthem speechless.\nAllah’s Power 1) The Day and Night\n86. Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest in and the day\nbright?[ 7 8 9 ] Surely in this are signs for those who believe.\nThe Apocalypse\n87. And ˹beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and all those in the\nheavens and all those on the earth will be horrified ˹to the point of death˺,\n[790] except those Allah wills ˹to spare˺. And all will come before Him, fully\nhumbled.\nAllah’s Power 2) Earth’s Rotation\n88. Now you see the mountains, thinking they are firmly fixed, but they are\ntravelling ˹just˺ like clouds. ˹That is˺ the design of Allah, Who has perfected\neverything. Surely He is All-Aware of what you do.\nJudgment Day\n89. Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with what is better,\nand they will be secure from the horror on that Day. 90. And whoever\ncomes with an evil deed will be hurled face-first into the Fire. Are you\nrewarded except for what you used to do?\nAdvice to the Prophet\n91. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of\nthis city ˹of Mecca˺, Who has made it sacred, and to Him belongs\neverything. And I am commanded to be one of those who ˹fully˺ submit ˹to\nHim˺, 92. and to recite the Quran.” Then whoever chooses to be guided, it is\nonly for their own good. But whoever chooses to stray, say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I\nam only a warner.” 93. And say, “All praise is for Allah! He will show you\nHis signs, and you will recognize them. And your Lord is never unaware of\nwhat you do.”\n***\n\n-- 335 of 694 --\n\n28. The Whole Story\n(Al-Qaṣaṣ)\nIn 26:18-19, Pharaoh reminds Moses (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) of his up-bringing in the\ncare of Pharaoh and how Moses (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) killed an Egyptian (accidentally).\nUnlike the previous sûrah, this Meccan sûrah focuses on these two aspects\nof Moses’ life in Egypt, along with his escape to Midian where he met his\nfuture wife. Another aspect is the story of Korah, one of the people of\nMoses, who behaved arrogantly, leading to his own destruction. Just like\nthe previous sûrah, it reaffirms Allah’s power and the authenticity of the\nQuran. Again, the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reminded that his duty is not to\nconvert, but to convey. After criticizing the polytheists (verses 45-75), the\nsûrah concludes by bidding the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to be steadfast. The next\nsûrah starts off by talking about steadfastness.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nPharaoh’s Tyranny\n1.\nṬâ-Sĩn-Mĩm. 2. These are the verses of the clear Book. 3. We narrate to\nyou ˹O Prophet˺ part of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for people\nwho believe. 4. Indeed, Pharaoh ˹arrogantly˺ elevated himself in the land\nand divided its people into ˹subservient˺ groups, one of which he\npersecuted, slaughtering their sons and keeping their women. He was truly\none of the corruptors. 5. But it was Our Will to favour those who were\noppressed in the land, making them models ˹of faith˺ as well as successors;\n6. and to establish them in the land; and through them show Pharaoh,\nHamân,[791] and their soldiers ˹the fulfilment of˺ what they feared.[792]\nBaby Moses in the Nile\n7. We inspired the mother of Moses: “Nurse him, but when you fear for\nhim, put him then into the river, and do not fear or grieve. We will certainly\nreturn him to you, and make him one of the messengers.” 8. And ˹it so\nhappened that˺ Pharaoh’s people picked him up, only to become their\nenemy and source of grief. Surely Pharaoh, Hamân, and their soldiers were\nsinful.\n\n-- 336 of 694 --\n\nMoses in the Palace\n9. Pharaoh’s wife said ˹to him˺, “˹This baby is˺ a source of joy for me and\nyou. Do not kill him. Perhaps he may be useful to us or we may adopt him\nas a son.” They were unaware ˹of what was to come˺. 10. And the heart of\nMoses’ mother ached so much that she almost gave away his identity, had\nWe not reassured her heart in order for her to have faith ˹in Allah’s\npromise˺. 11. And she said to his sister, “Keep track of him!” So she\nwatched him from a distance, while they were unaware. 12. And We had\ncaused him to refuse all wet-nurses at first, so his sister suggested, “Shall I\ndirect you to a family who will bring him up for you and take good care of\nhim?” 13. This is how We returned him to his mother so that her heart\nwould be put at ease, and not grieve, and that she would know that Allah’s\npromise is ˹always˺ true. But most people do not know. 14. And when he\nreached full strength and maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge.\nThis is how We reward the good-doers.\nUnintentional Killing\n15. ˹One day˺ he entered the city unnoticed by its people.[793] There he\nfound two men fighting: one of his own people, and the other of his\nenemies. The man from his people called to him for help against his foe. So\nMoses punched him, causing his death. Moses cried, “This is from Satan’s\nhandiwork. He is certainly a sworn, misleading enemy.” 16. He pleaded,\n“My Lord! I have definitely wronged my soul, so forgive me.” So He\nforgave him, ˹for˺ He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 17. Moses\npledged, “My Lord! For all Your favours upon me, I will never side with\nthe wicked.”\nThe Incident Comes to Light\n18. And so Moses became fearful, watching out in the city, when suddenly\nthe one who sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help.\nMoses rebuked him, “Indeed, you are clearly a trouble-maker.” 19. Then\nwhen Moses was about to lay his hands on their foe,[794] the enemy said, “O\nMoses! Do you intend to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? You only\nwant to be a tyrant in the land. You do not intend to make peace!”\nMoses Escapes to Midian\n\n-- 337 of 694 --\n\n20. And there came a man, rushing from the farthest end of the city. He\nsaid, “O Moses! The chiefs are actually conspiring against you to put you to\ndeath, so leave ˹the city˺. I really advise you ˹to do so˺.” 21. So Moses left\nthe city in a state of fear and caution, praying, “My Lord! Deliver me from\nthe wrongdoing people.” 22. And as he made his way towards Midian, he\nsaid, “I trust my Lord will guide me to the right way.”\nMoses Helps Two Women\n23. When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found a group of people\nwatering ˹their herds˺. Apart from them, he noticed two women holding\nback ˹their herd˺. He asked ˹them˺, “What is the problem?” They replied,\n“We cannot water ˹our animals˺ until the ˹other˺ shepherds are done, for our\nfather is a very old man.” 24. So he watered ˹their herd˺ for them, then\nwithdrew to the shade and prayed, “My Lord! I am truly in ˹desperate˺ need\nof whatever provision You may have in store for me.”[795]\nMoses Gets Married\n25. Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully. She said,\n“My father is inviting you so he may reward you for watering ˹our animals˺\nfor us.” When Moses came to him and told him his whole story, the old man\nsaid, “Have no fear! You are ˹now˺ safe from the wrongdoing people.” 26.\nOne of the two daughters suggested, “O my dear father! Hire him. The best\nman for employment is definitely the strong and trustworthy ˹one˺.” 27. The\nold man proposed, “I wish to marry one of these two daughters of mine to\nyou, provided that you stay in my service for eight years. If you complete\nten, it will be ˹a favour˺ from you, but I do not wish to make it difficult for\nyou. Allah willing, you will find me an agreeable man.” 28. Moses\nresponded, “˹Then˺ it is ˹settled˺ between you and I. Whichever term I\nfulfill, there will be no ˹further˺ obligation on me. And Allah is a Witness to\nwhat we say.”\nThe Fateful Encounter\n29. When Moses had completed the term and was travelling with his family,\nhe spotted a fire on the side of Mount Ṭûr. He said to his family, “Stay here,\n˹for˺ I have spotted a fire. Perhaps from there I can bring you some\ndirections[796] or a torch from the fire so you may warm yourselves.” 30.\nBut when he came to it, he was called from the bush in the sacred ground to\n\n-- 338 of 694 --\n\nthe right side of the valley: “O Moses! It is truly I. I am Allah—the Lord of\nall worlds. 31. Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering\nlike a snake, he ran away without looking back. ˹Allah reassured him,˺ “O\nMoses! Draw near, and have no fear. You are perfectly secure. 32. Now put\nyour hand through ˹the opening of˺ your collar, it will come out ˹shining˺\nwhite, unblemished.[797] And cross your arms tightly to calm your fears.[798]\nThese are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. They have\ntruly been a rebellious people.”\nMoses Asks Allah for Help\n33. Moses appealed, “My Lord! I have indeed killed a man from them, so I\nfear they may kill me. 34. And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I,\nso send him with me as a helper to support what I say, for I truly fear they\nmay reject me.” 35. Allah responded, “We will assist you with your brother\nand grant you both authority, so they cannot harm you. With Our signs, you\nand those who follow you will ˹certainly˺ prevail.”\nPharaoh’s Response\n36. But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said\n˹arrogantly˺, “This is nothing but conjured magic ˹tricks˺. We have never\nheard of this in ˹the history of˺ our forefathers.” 37. Moses responded, “My\nLord knows best who has come with ˹true˺ guidance from Him and will fare\nbest in the end. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.” 38. Pharaoh\ndeclared, “O chiefs! I know of no other god for you but myself. So bake\nbricks out of clay for me, O Hamân, and build a high tower so I may look at\nthe God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.”\nEnd of Pharaoh\n39. And so he and his soldiers behaved arrogantly in the land with no right,\nthinking they would never be returned to Us. 40. So We seized him and his\nsoldiers, casting them into the sea. See then what was the end of the\nwrongdoers! 41. We made them leaders inviting ˹others˺ to the Fire. And on\nthe Day of Judgment they will not be helped. 42. We caused a curse to\nfollow them in this world. And on the Day of Judgment they will be among\nthe outcasts.\nExcellence of the Torah\n\n-- 339 of 694 --\n\n43. Indeed, We gave Moses the Scripture—after destroying earlier nations\n—as an insight for the people, a guide, and mercy so perhaps they would be\nmindful.\nRevealed Stories\n44. You were not there ˹O Prophet˺ on the western side of the mountain\nwhen We entrusted the Commandments to Moses, nor were you present ˹in\nhis time˺.[799] 45. But We ˹later˺ raised ˹several˺ generations, and the ages\ntook their toll on them.[800] Nor were you living among the people of\nMidian, rehearsing Our revelations with them. But it is We Who have sent\n˹this revelation to you˺. 46. And you were not at the side of Mount Ṭûr\nwhen We called out ˹to Moses˺. But ˹you have been sent˺ as a mercy from\nyour Lord to warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, so\nperhaps they may be mindful. 47. Also so they would not say, if struck by\nan affliction for what their hands have done: “Our Lord! If only You had\nsent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations and become\nbelievers.”\nPagan Response to the Quran\n48. But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was\ngiven the like of what Moses had been given.”[801] Did they not deny what\nhad been given to Moses earlier? They claimed, “Both ˹Scriptures˺ are\nworks of magic, supporting each other!”[802] Adding, “We truly deny both.”\n49. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Bring then a scripture from Allah which is a better\nguide than these two so I may follow it, if your claim is true.” 50. So if they\nfail to respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. And\nwho could be more astray than those who follow their desires with no\nguidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.\nThe Doubly Rewarded\n51. Indeed, We have steadily delivered the Word ˹of Allah˺ to the people so\nthey may be mindful. 52. ˹As for˺ those ˹faithful˺ to whom We had given the\nScripture before this ˹Quran˺, they do believe in it. 53. When it is recited to\nthem, they declare, “We believe in it. This is definitely the truth from our\nLord. We had already submitted[803] ˹even˺ before this.” 54. These\n˹believers˺ will be given a double reward for their perseverance, responding\nto evil with good, and for donating from what We have provided for them.\n\n-- 340 of 694 --\n\n55. When they hear slanderous talk, they turn away from it, saying, “We are\naccountable for our deeds and you for yours. Peace ˹is our only response˺ to\nyou! We want nothing to do with those who act ignorantly.”\nGuidance Is from Allah Alone\n56. You surely cannot guide whoever you like ˹O Prophet˺, but it is Allah\nWho guides whoever He wills, and He knows best who are ˹fit to be˺\nguided.\nPagan Excuses\n57. They say ˹to the Prophet˺, “If we were to follow ˹true˺ guidance with\nyou, we would certainly be snatched away from our land.” Have We not\nestablished for them a safe haven ˹in Mecca˺ to which fruits of all kinds are\nbrought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know ˹this\nfavour˺. 58. ˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed that had been\nspoiled by their ˹comfortable˺ living! Those are their residences, never\ninhabited after them except passingly.[804] And We ˹alone˺ were the\nSuccessor. 59. Your Lord would never destroy a society until He had sent to\nits capital a messenger, reciting Our revelations to them. Nor would We\never destroy a society unless its people persisted in wrongdoing.\nThis World or the Hereafter?\n60. Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is no more than ˹a fleeting˺\nenjoyment and adornment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far\nbetter and more lasting. Will you not then understand? 61. Can those to\nwhom We have made a fine promise—which they will see fulfilled—be like\nthose who We have allowed to enjoy the pleasures of this worldly life, but\non the Day of Judgment will be brought ˹for punishment˺?\nThe Misleaders and the Misled\n62. ˹Watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, “Where are those you claimed\nwere My associate-gods?” 63. Those ˹misleaders˺ against whom the decree\n˹of torment˺ is justified will cry, “Our Lord! These ˹followers˺ are the ones\nwe caused to deviate. We led them into deviance, for we ourselves were\ndeviant. We disassociate ourselves ˹from them˺ before You. It was not us\nthat they used to worship.” 64. It will be said ˹to the disbelievers˺, “Call\nupon your associate-gods ˹for help˺.” So they will call them, but will\n\n-- 341 of 694 --\n\nreceive no response. And they will face the punishment, wishing they had\nbeen ˹rightly˺ guided!\nA Question to the Disbelievers\n65. And ˹watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, asking, “What response\ndid you give to the messengers?” 66. They will be too dumbstruck on that\nDay to ask one another ˹for answers˺.\nThe True Believers\n67. As for those who repent, believe, and do good ˹in this world˺, it is right\nto hope that they will be among the successful.\nAllah Almighty\n68. Your Lord creates and chooses whatever He wills—the choice is not\ntheirs. Glorified and Exalted is Allah above what they associate ˹with Him˺!\n69. And your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal.\n70. He is Allah. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. All praise\nbelongs to Him in this life and the next. All authority is His. And to Him\nyou will ˹all˺ be returned.\nAllah’s Might and Grace\n71. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Imagine if Allah were to make the night\nperpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah\ncould bring you sunlight? Will you not then listen?” 72. Ask ˹them also˺,\n“Imagine if Allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of\nJudgment, which god other than Allah could bring you night to rest in? Will\nyou not then see?” 73. It is out of His mercy that He has made for you the\nday and night so that you may rest ˹in the latter˺ and seek His bounty ˹in the\nformer˺, and perhaps you will be grateful.\nPolytheists Rebuked Again\n74. And ˹watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, “Where are those you\nclaimed were My associate-gods?” 75. And We will bring forth a\nwitness[805] from every faith-community and ask ˹the polytheists˺, “Show\n˹Us˺ your proof.” Then they will ˹come to˺ know that the truth is with Allah\n˹alone˺. And whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them.\nKorah’s Arrogance\n76. Indeed, Korah[806] was from the people of Moses, but he behaved\narrogantly towards them. We had granted him such treasures that even their\n\n-- 342 of 694 --\n\nkeys would burden a group of strong men. ˹Some of˺ his people advised\nhim, “Do not be prideful! Surely Allah does not like the prideful. 77.\nRather, seek the ˹reward˺ of the Hereafter by means of what Allah has\ngranted you, without forgetting your share of this world. And be good ˹to\nothers˺ as Allah has been good to you. Do not seek to spread corruption in\nthe land, for Allah certainly does not like the corruptors.”\nKorah’s Response\n78. He replied, “I have been granted all this because of some knowledge I\nhave.”[807] Did he not know that Allah had already destroyed some from the\ngenerations before him who were far superior to him in power and greater\nin accumulating ˹wealth˺? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked\nabout their sins.[808]\nDebate on Korah\n79. Then he came out before his people in all his glamour. Those who\ndesired the life of this world wished, “If only we could have something like\nwhat Korah has been given. He is truly a man of great fortune!” 80. But\nthose gifted with knowledge said, “Shame on you! Allah’s reward is far\nbetter for those who believe and do good. But none will attain this except\nthe steadfast.”\nKorah’s End\n81. Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, along with his home.\nThere was no one to help him against Allah, nor could he even help\nhimself. 82. And those who had craved his position the previous day began\nto say, “Ah! It is certainly Allah Who gives abundant or limited provisions\nto whoever He wills of His servants. Had it not been for the grace of Allah,\nHe could have surely caused the earth to swallow us up! Oh, indeed! The\ndisbelievers will never succeed.”\nPay Day\n83. That ˹eternal˺ Home in the Hereafter We reserve ˹only˺ for those who\nseek neither tyranny nor corruption on the earth. The ultimate outcome\nbelongs ˹only˺ to the righteous. 84. Whoever comes with a good deed will\nbe rewarded with what is better. And whoever comes with an evil deed,\nthen the evildoers will only be rewarded for what they used to do.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n\n-- 343 of 694 --\n\n85. Most certainly, the One Who has ordained the Quran for you will\n˹ultimately˺ bring you back home ˹to Mecca˺.[809] Say, “My Lord knows\nbest who has come with ˹true˺ guidance and who is clearly astray.” 86. You\nnever expected this Book to be revealed to you, but ˹it came˺ only ˹as˺ a\nmercy from your Lord. So never side with the disbelievers ˹in their\ndisbelief˺. 87. Do not let them turn you away from the revelations of Allah\nafter they have been sent down to you. Rather, invite ˹all˺ to ˹the Way of˺\nyour Lord, and never be one of the polytheists. 88. And do not invoke any\nother god with Allah. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him.\nEverything is bound to perish except He Himself.[810] All authority belongs\nto Him. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.\n***\n\n-- 344 of 694 --\n\n29. The Spider\n(Al-’Ankabût)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the parable of the spider in verse\n41. The beginning of the sûrah emphasizes the role of trials and tribulations\nin revealing those who are truly steadfast and those who are not. Noah,\nAbraham, Lot, and Shu’aib are noted for their perseverance. References are\nmade to various peoples and the different ways they were destroyed for\ntheir denial of the truth (verse 40). The pagan arguments against the\nProphet and the Quran are thoroughly refuted. The sûrah concludes by\ncommending those who put their trust in Allah and strive in His cause. This\nconclusion paves the way for the opening of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Test\n1. Alif-Lãm-Mĩm. 2. Do people think once they say, “We believe,” that they\nwill be left without being put to the test? 3. We certainly tested those before\nthem. And ˹in this way˺ Allah will clearly distinguish between those who\nare truthful and those who are liars. 4. Or do the evildoers ˹simply˺ think\nthat they will escape Us? How wrong is their judgment!\nThe True Believers\n5. Whoever hopes for the meeting with Allah, ˹let them know that˺ Allah’s\nappointed time is sure to come. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 6. And\nwhoever strives ˹in Allah’s cause˺, only does so for their own good. Surely\nAllah is not in need of ˹any of˺ His creation. 7. As for those who believe\nand do good, We will certainly absolve them of their sins, and reward them\naccording to the best of what they used to do. 8. We have commanded\npeople to honour their parents. But if they urge you to associate with Me\nwhat you have no knowledge of,[811] then do not obey them. To Me you will\n˹all˺ return, and then I will inform you of what you used to do. 9. Those\nwho believe and do good will surely be admitted by Us into ˹the company\nof˺ the righteous.\nThe Hypocrites\n\n-- 345 of 694 --\n\n10. There are some who say, “We believe in Allah,” but when they suffer in\nthe cause of Allah, they mistake ˹this˺ persecution at the hands of people for\nthe punishment of Allah. But when victory comes from your Lord, they\nsurely say ˹to the believers˺, “We have always been with you.” Does Allah\nnot know best what is in the hearts of all beings? 11. Allah will certainly\ndistinguish between those who have ˹sure˺ faith and the hypocrites.\nFalse Promise\n12. The disbelievers say to the believers, “˹Just˺ follow our way, and we\nwill bear ˹the burden of˺ your sins.” But they would never ˹want to˺ bear\nany of the believers’ sins. They are simply lying. 13. Yet they will certainly\n˹be made to˺ carry their own burdens, as well as other burdens along with\ntheir own.[812] And they will surely be questioned on Judgment Day about\nwhat they used to fabricate.\nNoah's People Destroyed\n14. Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them for a\nthousand years, less fifty. Then the Flood overtook them, while they\npersisted in wrongdoing. 15. But We delivered him and those in the Ark,\nmaking it a sign for all people.\nThe People of Abraham\n16. And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said to his people, “Worship Allah, and\nfear Him. This is better for you, if only you knew. 17. You worship besides\nAllah nothing but idols, simply creating lies ˹about them˺. Those you\nworship besides Allah certainly cannot give you any provision. So seek\nprovision from Allah ˹alone˺, worship Him, and be grateful to Him. To Him\nyou will ˹all˺ be returned.”\nWarning to Meccan Pagans\n18. If you persist in denial, so did ˹many˺ communities before you. The\nMessenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly. 19. Have they not\nseen how Allah originates the creation then resurrects it? That is certainly\neasy for Allah. 20. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Travel throughout the land and see\nhow He originated the creation, then Allah will bring it into being one more\ntime. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. 21. He punishes whoever\nHe wills, and shows mercy to whoever He wills. And you will ˹all˺ be\nreturned to Him. 22. And you cannot escape Him on earth or in heaven. Nor\n\n-- 346 of 694 --\n\nhave you any protector or helper besides Allah.” 23. As for those who\ndisbelieve in Allah’s signs and the meeting with Him, it is they who will\nhave no hope in His mercy.[813] And it is they who will suffer a painful\npunishment.\nAbraham Prevails\n24. But the only response of Abraham’s people was to say: “Kill him or\nburn him!” But Allah saved him from the fire.[814] Surely in this are signs\nfor people who believe. 25. He said ˹to his people˺, “You have taken idols\n˹for worship˺ instead of Allah, only to keep ˹the bond of˺ harmony among\nyourselves in this worldly life. But on the Day of Judgment you will disown\nand curse one another. Your home will be the Fire, and you will have no\nhelper!” 26. So Lot believed in him. And Abraham said, “I am emigrating\n˹in obedience˺ to my Lord. He ˹alone˺ is indeed the Almighty, All-Wise.”\n27. We blessed him with Isaac and ˹later˺ Jacob, and reserved prophethood\nand revelation for his descendants. We gave him his reward in this life,[815]\nand in the Hereafter he will certainly be among the righteous.\nThe People of Lot\n28. And ˹remember˺ when Lot rebuked ˹the men of˺ his people: “You\ncertainly commit a shameful deed that no man has ever done before you.\n29. Do you really lust after ˹other˺ men, abuse the travellers, and practice\nimmorality ˹openly˺ in your gatherings?” His people’s only response was to\nsay ˹mockingly˺: “Bring Allah’s punishment upon us, if what you say is\ntrue.” 30. Lot prayed, “My Lord! Help me against the people of\ncorruption.”\nAbraham Visited by Angels\n31. When Our messenger-angels came to Abraham with the good news ˹of\nthe birth of Isaac˺, they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this city\n˹of Sodom˺, for its people have persisted in wrongdoing.” 32. He said, “But\nLot is there!” They responded, “We know best who is there. We will\ncertainly save him and his family—except his wife, who is one of the\ndoomed.”\nThe People of Lot Destroyed\n33. And when Our messenger-angels came to Lot, he was distressed and\nworried by their arrival.[816] They reassured ˹him˺, “Do not fear, nor grieve.\n\n-- 347 of 694 --\n\nWe will surely deliver you and your family—except your wife, who is one\nof the doomed. 34. We are certainly bringing down a punishment from\nheaven upon the people of this city for their rebelliousness.” 35. And We\ndid leave ˹some of˺ its ruins as a clear lesson for people of understanding.\nShu'aib's People Destroyed\n36. And to the people of Midian ˹We sent˺ their brother Shu’aib. He said,\n“O my people! Worship Allah, and hope for ˹the reward of˺ the Last Day.\nAnd do not go about spreading corruption in the land.” 37. But they rejected\nhim, so an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in\ntheir homes.\nPreviously Destroyed Nations\n38. And the people of ’Ȃd and Thamûd ˹met a similar fate˺, which must be\nclear to you ˹Meccans˺ from their ruins.[817] Satan made their ˹evil˺ deeds\nappealing to them, hindering them from the ˹Right˺ Way, although they\nwere capable of reasoning. 39. ˹We˺ also ˹destroyed˺ Korah, Pharaoh, and\nHamân. Indeed, Moses had come to them with clear proofs, but they\nbehaved arrogantly in the land. Yet they could not escape ˹Us˺. 40. So We\nseized each ˹people˺ for their sin: against some of them We sent a storm of\nstones, some were overtaken by a ˹mighty˺ blast, some We caused the earth\nto swallow, and some We drowned. Allah would not have wronged them,\nbut it was they who wronged themselves.\nAllah Is the Mighty Protector\n41. The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of a\nspider spinning a shelter. And the flimsiest of all shelters is certainly that of\na spider, if only they knew.[818] 42. Allah surely knows that whatever ˹gods˺\nthey invoke besides Him are ˹simply˺ nothing. For He is the Almighty, All-\nWise. 43. These are the parables We set forth for humanity, but none will\nunderstand them except the people of knowledge. 44. Allah created the\nheavens and the earth for a purpose. Surely in this is a sign for the people of\nfaith.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n45. Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer.\nIndeed, ˹genuine˺ prayer should deter ˹one˺ from indecency and wickedness.\n\n-- 348 of 694 --\n\nThe remembrance of Allah is ˹an˺ even greater ˹deterrent˺. And Allah ˹fully˺\nknows what you ˹all˺ do.\nArguing with the People of the Book\n46. Do not argue with the People of the Book unless gracefully, except with\nthose of them who act wrongfully. And say, “We believe in what has been\nrevealed to us and what was revealed to you. Our God and your God is\n˹only˺ One. And to Him we ˹fully˺ submit.”\nOne Last Revelation\n47. Similarly ˹to earlier messengers˺, We have revealed to you a Book ˹O\nProphet˺. ˹The faithful of˺ those to whom We gave the Scriptures believe in\nit, as do some of these ˹pagan Arabs˺. And none denies Our revelations\nexcept the ˹stubborn˺ disbelievers. 48. You ˹O Prophet˺ could not read any\nwriting ˹even˺ before this ˹revelation˺, nor could you write at all. Otherwise,\nthe people of falsehood would have been suspicious. 49. But this ˹Quran˺ is\n˹a set of˺ clear revelations ˹preserved˺ in the hearts of those gifted with\nknowledge. And none denies Our revelations except the ˹stubborn˺\nwrongdoers.\nThe Pagans Demand Signs[819]\n50. They say, “If only ˹some˺ signs had been sent down to him from his\nLord!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Signs are only with Allah. And I am only sent\nwith a clear warning.” 51. Is it not enough for them that We have sent down\nto you the Book, ˹which is˺ recited to them. Surely in this ˹Quran˺ is a\nmercy and reminder for people who believe. 52. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Sufficient is Allah as a Witness between me and you. He ˹fully˺ knows\nwhatever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believe in\nfalsehood and disbelieve in Allah, it is they who are the ˹true˺ losers.”\nHastening the Punishment\n53. They challenge you ˹O Prophet˺ to hasten the punishment. Had it not\nbeen for a time already set, the punishment would have certainly come to\nthem ˹at once˺. But it will definitely take them by surprise when they least\nexpect it. 54. They urge you to hasten the punishment. And Hell will\ncertainly encompass the disbelievers 55. on the Day the punishment will\noverwhelm them from above them and from below their feet. And it will be\nsaid, “Reap what you sowed.”\n\n-- 349 of 694 --\n\nAdvice to Persecuted Believers[820]\n56. O My believing servants! My earth is truly spacious, so worship Me\n˹alone˺. 57. Every soul will taste death, then to Us you will ˹all˺ be returned.\n58. ˹As for˺ those who believe and do good, We will certainly house them in\n˹elevated˺ mansions in Paradise, under which rivers flow, to stay there\nforever. How excellent is the reward for those who work ˹righteousness!˺—\n59. those who patiently endure, and put their trust in their Lord! 60. How\nmany are the creatures that cannot secure their provisions! ˹It is˺ Allah\n˹Who˺ provides for them and you ˹as well˺. He is indeed the All-Hearing,\nAll-Knowing.\nQuestions to the Polytheists\n61. If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth and\nsubjected the sun and the moon ˹for your benefit˺, they will certainly say,\n“Allah!” How can they then be deluded ˹from the truth˺? 62. Allah gives\nabundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. Surely\nAllah has ˹full˺ knowledge of everything. 63. And if you ask them who\nsends down rain from the sky, giving life to the earth after its death, they\nwill surely say, “Allah!” Say, “Praise be to Allah!” In fact, most of them do\nnot understand. 64. This worldly life is no more than play and amusement.\nBut the Hereafter is indeed the real life, if only they knew.\nThe Disbelievers' Ingratitude\n65. If they happen to be aboard a ship ˹caught in a storm˺, they cry out to\nAllah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion. But as soon as He delivers them ˹safely˺\nto shore, they associate ˹others with Him once again˺. 66. So let them be\nungrateful for all We have given them, and ˹let them˺ enjoy themselves ˹for\nnow˺! For they will soon know.\nWarning to Meccan Pagans\n67. Have they not seen how We have made ˹Mecca˺ a safe haven, whereas\npeople ˹all˺ around them are snatched away?[821] How can they then believe\nin falsehood[822] and deny Allah’s favours? 68. And who does more wrong\nthan those who fabricate lies against Allah or reject the truth after it has\nreached them? Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the disbelievers?\nThe Faithful Reassured\n\n-- 350 of 694 --\n\n69. As for those who struggle in Our cause, We will surely guide them\nalong Our Way. And Allah is certainly with the good-doers.\n***\n\n-- 351 of 694 --\n\n30. The Romans\n(Ar-Rûm)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the reference to the Romans in verse\n2. The world’s superpowers in the early 7th century were the Roman\nByzantine and Persian Empires. When they went to war in 614 C.E., the\nRomans suffered a devastating defeat. The Meccan pagans rejoiced at the\ndefeat of the Roman Christians at the hands of the Persian pagans. Soon\nverses 30:1-5 were revealed, stating that the Romans would be victorious in\nthree to nine years. Eight years later, the Romans won a decisive battle\nagainst the Persians, reportedly on the same day the Muslims vanquished\nthe Meccan army at the Battle of Badr. As the sûrah progresses, several\nblessings and natural signs are cited to prove Allah’s infinite mercy and\npower, coupled with condemnations to the pagans for their ingratitude and\nfor associating powerless idols with Allah in worship. The sûrah closes by\nbidding the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) not to be disheartened by what the deniers\nsay.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nFrom Defeat to Victory\n1. Alif-Lãm-Mĩm. 2. The Romans have been defeated 3. in a nearby land.\n[823] Yet following their defeat, they will triumph 4. within three to nine\nyears. The ˹whole˺ matter rests with Allah before and after ˹victory˺. And on\nthat day the believers will rejoice 5. at the victory willed by Allah. He gives\nvictory to whoever He wills. For He is the Almighty, Most Merciful. 6.\n˹This is˺ the promise of Allah. ˹And˺ Allah never fails in His promise. But\nmost people do not know. 7. They ˹only˺ know the worldly affairs of this\nlife, but are ˹totally˺ oblivious to the Hereafter.\nWake-up Call to the Disbelievers\n8. Have they not reflected upon their own being? Allah only created the\nheavens and the earth and everything in between for a purpose and an\nappointed term. Yet most people are truly in denial of the meeting with their\nLord! 9. Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the\n\n-- 352 of 694 --\n\nend of those ˹destroyed˺ before them? They were far superior in might; they\ncultivated the land and developed it more than these ˹Meccans˺ ever have.\nTheir messengers came to them with clear proofs. Allah would have never\nwronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves. 10. Then most evil\nwas the end of the evildoers for denying and mocking the signs of Allah.\nThe Wicked on Judgment Day\n11. It is Allah Who originates the creation, and will resurrect it. And then to\nHim you will ˹all˺ be returned. 12. On the Day the Hour will arrive, the\nwicked will be dumbstruck. 13. There will be no intercessors for them from\namong their associate-gods, and they will ˹totally˺ deny their associate-\ngods.\nThe Blessed and the Doomed\n14. And on the Day the Hour will arrive, the people will then be split ˹into\ntwo groups˺. 15. As for those who believed and did good, they will be\nrejoicing in a Garden. 16. And as for those who disbelieved, and denied Our\nsigns and the meeting ˹with Allah˺ in the Hereafter, they will be confined in\npunishment.\nKeeping up Prayers\n17. So glorify Allah in the evening and in the morning— 18. all praise is for\nHim in the heavens and the earth—as well as in the afternoon, and at noon.\n[824]\nAllah’s Power over Life and Death\n19. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living.\nAnd He gives life to the earth after its death. And so will you be brought\nforth ˹from the grave˺.\nAllah’s Signs 1) Creation of Humankind\n20. One of His signs is that He created you from dust, then—behold!—you\nare human beings spreading over ˹the earth˺.\nAllah’s Signs 2) Spouses\n21. And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among\nyourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed\nbetween you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who\nreflect.\n\n-- 353 of 694 --\n\nAllah’s Signs 3) Diversity\n22. And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and\nthe diversity of your languages and colours. Surely in this are signs for\nthose of ˹sound˺ knowledge.\nAllah’s Signs 4) Sleep and Work\n23. And one of His signs is your sleep by night and by day ˹for rest˺ as well\nas your seeking His bounty ˹in both˺. Surely in this are signs for people who\nlisten.\nAllah’s Signs 5) Lightning\n24. And one of His signs is that He shows you lightning, inspiring ˹you\nwith˺ hope and fear.[825] And He sends down rain from the sky, reviving the\nearth after its death. Surely in this are signs for people who understand.\nAllah’s Signs 6) The Universe\n25. And one of His signs is that the heavens and the earth persist by His\ncommand. Then when He calls you out of the earth just once, you will\ninstantly come forth. 26. And to Him belong all those in the heavens and\nthe earth—all are subject to His Will.[826] 27. And He is the One Who\noriginates the creation then will resurrect it—which is even easier for Him.\n[827] To Him belong the finest attributes in the heavens and the earth. And\nHe is the Almighty, All-Wise.\nAn Example for the Polytheists\n28. He sets forth for you an example ˹drawn˺ from your own lives: would\nyou allow some of those ˹bondspeople˺ in your possession to be your equal\npartners in whatever ˹wealth˺ We have provided you, keeping them in mind\nas you are mindful of your peers?[828] This is how We make the signs clear\nfor people who understand. 29. In fact, the wrongdoers merely follow their\ndesires with no knowledge. Who then can guide those Allah has left to\nstray? They will have no helpers.\nHold Firmly to Faith\n30. So be steadfast in faith in all uprightness ˹O Prophet˺—the natural Way\nof Allah which He has instilled in ˹all˺ people. Let there be no change in\nthis creation of Allah. That is the Straight Way, but most people do not\nknow. 31. ˹O believers!˺ Always turn to Him ˹in repentance˺, be mindful of\nHim, and establish prayers. And do not be polytheists— 32. ˹like˺ those\n\n-- 354 of 694 --\n\nwho have divided their faith and split into sects, each rejoicing in what they\nhave.\nHuman Ingratitude\n33. When people are touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord,\nturning to Him ˹alone˺. But as soon as He gives them a taste of His mercy, a\ngroup of them associates ˹others˺ with their Lord ˹in worship˺, 34. becoming\nungrateful for whatever ˹favours˺ We have given them. So enjoy yourselves,\nfor soon you will know. 35. Or have We sent down to them an authority\nwhich attests to what they associate ˹with Him˺?\nHuman Impatience\n36. If We give people a taste of mercy, they become prideful ˹because˺ of it.\nBut if they are afflicted with an evil for what their hands have done, they\ninstantly fall into despair.\nInterest vs. Charity\n37. Have they not seen that Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to\nwhoever He wills? Surely in this are signs for people who believe. 38. So\ngive your close relatives their due, as well as the poor and the ˹needy˺\ntraveller. That is best for those who seek the pleasure of Allah,[829] and it is\nthey who will be successful. 39. Whatever loans you give, ˹only˺ seeking\ninterest at the expense of people’s wealth[830] will not increase with Allah.\nBut whatever charity you give, ˹only˺ seeking the pleasure of Allah—it is\nthey whose reward will be multiplied.\nAllah’s Might\n40. It is Allah Who created you, then gives you provisions, then will cause\nyou to die, and then will bring you back to life. Can any of your associate-\ngods do any of this? Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate\nwith Him ˹in worship˺!\nThe Spread of Corruption\n41. Corruption has spread on land and sea as a result of what people’s hands\nhave done, so that Allah may cause them to taste ˹the consequences of˺\nsome of their deeds and perhaps they might return ˹to the Right Path˺. 42.\nSay, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Travel throughout the land and see what was the end of\nthose ˹destroyed˺ before ˹you˺—most of them were polytheists.”\nThe Successful and the Losers\n\n-- 355 of 694 --\n\n43. So be steadfast in the Upright Faith ˹O Prophet˺, before the coming of a\nDay from Allah that cannot be averted. On that Day the people will be\ndivided: 44. those who disbelieved will bear ˹the burden of˺ their own\ndisbelief; and those who did good will have prepared for themselves\n˹eternal homes˺, 45. so that He may ˹generously˺ reward those who believe\nand do good, out of His grace. He truly does not like the disbelievers.\nAllah’s Signs 7) The Wind\n46. And one of His signs is that He sends the winds, ushering in good news\n˹of rain˺ so that He may give you a taste of His mercy, and that ships may\nsail by His command, and that you may seek His bounty, and perhaps you\nwill be grateful.\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n47. Indeed, We sent before you ˹O Prophet˺ messengers, each to their own\npeople, and they came to them with clear proofs. Then We inflicted\npunishment upon those who persisted in wickedness. For it is Our duty to\nhelp the believers.\nAllah’s Signs 8) Rain\n48. It is Allah Who sends the winds, which then stir up ˹vapour, forming˺\nclouds, which He then spreads out in the sky or piles up into masses as He\nwills, from which you see rain come forth. Then as soon as He causes it to\nfall on whoever He wills of His servants, they rejoice, 49. although they had\nutterly lost hope just before it was sent down to them. 50. See then the\nimpact of Allah’s mercy: how He gives life to the earth after its death!\nSurely That ˹same Creator˺ can raise the dead. For He is Most Capable of\neverything. 51. Then if We send a ˹harsh˺ wind which they see withering\n˹their˺ crops, they will definitely deny ˹old favours˺ right after.\nThe Dead, Deaf, and Blind\n52. So you ˹O Prophet˺ certainly cannot make the dead hear ˹the truth˺. Nor\ncan you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and walk\naway. 53. Nor can you lead the blind out of their misguidance. You can\nmake none hear ˹the truth˺ except those who believe in Our revelations,\n˹fully˺ submitting ˹to Allah˺.\nAllah’s Power of Creation\n\n-- 356 of 694 --\n\n54. It is Allah Who created you in a state of weakness, then developed\n˹your˺ weakness into strength, then developed ˹your˺ strength into weakness\nand old age.[831] He creates whatever He wills. For He is the All-Knowing,\nMost Capable.\nFleeting Life\n55. And on the Day the Hour will arrive, the wicked will swear that they did\nnot stay ˹in this world˺ more than an hour. In this way they were always\ndeluded ˹in the world˺. 56. But those gifted with knowledge and faith will\nsay ˹to them˺, “You did actually stay—as destined by Allah—until the Day\nof Resurrection. So here is the Day of Resurrection ˹which you denied˺! But\nyou did not know ˹it was true˺.” 57. So on that Day the wrongdoers’\nexcuses will not benefit them, nor will they be allowed to appease ˹their\nLord˺.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n58. We have certainly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people in this\nQuran. And no matter what sign you bring to them ˹O Prophet˺, the\ndisbelievers will definitely say ˹to the believers˺, “You are only a people of\nfalsehood.” 59. This is how Allah seals the hearts of those unwilling to\nknow ˹the truth˺. 60. So be patient, for the promise of Allah certainly is true.\nAnd do not be disturbed by those who have no sure faith.\n***\n\n-- 357 of 694 --\n\n31. Luqmân\n(Luqmân)\nThis Meccan sûrah is named after Luqmân, a wise African man who is\nquoted giving pieces of advice to his son (verses 12–19) on one’s\nrelationship with Allah and the people. While the believers are praised, the\npagans are condemned for their ingratitude, distracting others from the\nWay of Allah, and for setting up idols as His equals. Similar to the previous\nsûrah, references are made to Allah’s natural marvels, challenging the\ndeniers to point out anything their gods have created. The sûrah concludes\nby warning humanity of the Day of Judgment, ushering in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nQualities of True Believers\n1. Alif-Lãm-Mĩm. 2. These are the verses of the Book, rich in wisdom. 3. ˹It\nis˺ a guide and mercy for the good-doers— 4. those who establish prayer,\npay alms-tax, and have sure faith in the Hereafter. 5. It is they who are\n˹truly˺ guided by their Lord, and it is they who will be successful.\nDistracting People from the Truth\n6. But there are some who employ theatrics,[832] only to lead others away\nfrom Allah’s Way—without any knowledge—and to make a mockery of it.\nThey will suffer a humiliating punishment. 7. Whenever Our revelations are\nrecited to them, they turn away in arrogance as if they did not hear them, as\nif there is deafness in their ears. So give them good news ˹O Prophet˺ of a\npainful punishment.\nReward of the Believers\n8. Surely those who believe and do good will have the Gardens of Bliss, 9.\nstaying there forever. Allah’s promise is true. And He is the Almighty, All-\nWise.\nAllah’s Creation\n10. He created the heavens without pillars—as you can see—and placed\nfirm mountains upon the earth so it does not shake with you, and scattered\nthroughout it all types of creatures. And We send down rain from the sky,\n\n-- 358 of 694 --\n\ncausing every type of fine plant to grow on earth. 11. This is Allah’s\ncreation. Now show Me what those ˹gods˺ other than Him have created. In\nfact, the wrongdoers are clearly astray.\nLuqmân’s Advice: 1) Worship Allah Alone\n12. Indeed, We blessed Luqmân with wisdom, ˹saying˺, “Be grateful to\nAllah, for whoever is grateful, it is only for their own good. And whoever is\nungrateful, then surely Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.”[ 8 3 3 ] 13. And\n˹remember˺ when Luqmân said to his son, while advising him, “O my dear\nson! Never associate ˹anything˺ with Allah ˹in worship˺, for associating\n˹others with Him˺ is truly the worst of all wrongs.”\n2) Honour Your Parents[ 8 3 4 ]\n14. And We have commanded people to ˹honour˺ their parents. Their\nmothers bore them through hardship upon hardship, and their weaning takes\ntwo years. So be grateful to Me and your parents. To Me is the final return.\n15. But if they pressure you to associate with Me what you have no\nknowledge of,[835] do not obey them. Still keep their company in this world\ncourteously, and follow the way of those who turn to Me ˹in devotion˺.\nThen to Me you will ˹all˺ return, and then I will inform you of what you\nused to do.\n3) Know That Allah Will Judge All Deeds\n16. ˹Luqmân added,˺ “O my dear son! ˹Even˺ if a deed were the weight of a\nmustard seed—be it ˹hidden˺ in a rock or in the heavens or the earth—Allah\nwill bring it forth. Surely Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware.\n4) Fulfil Your Duty to Allah\n17. “O my dear son! Establish prayer, encourage what is good and forbid\nwhat is evil, and endure patiently whatever befalls you. Surely this is a\nresolve to aspire to.\n5) Be Humble\n18. “And do not turn your nose up to people, nor walk pridefully upon the\nearth. Surely Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful. 19. Be\nmoderate in your pace. And lower your voice, for the ugliest of all voices is\ncertainly the braying of donkeys.”\nAllah’s Favours\n\n-- 359 of 694 --\n\n20. Have you not seen that Allah has subjected for you whatever is in the\nheavens and whatever is on the earth, and has lavished His favours upon\nyou, both seen and unseen? ˹Still˺ there are some who dispute about Allah\nwithout knowledge, or guidance, or an enlightening scripture. 21. When it is\nsaid to them, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” they reply, “No! We ˹only˺\nfollow what we found our forefathers practicing.” ˹Would they still do so˺\neven if Satan is inviting them to the torment of the Blaze?\nThe Believers and the Disbelievers\n22. Whoever fully submits themselves to Allah and is a good-doer, they\nhave certainly grasped the firmest hand-hold. And with Allah rests the\noutcome of ˹all˺ affairs. 23. But whoever disbelieves, do not let their\ndisbelief grieve you ˹O Prophet˺. To Us is their return, and We will inform\nthem of all they did. Surely Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.\n24. We allow them enjoyment for a little while, then ˹in time˺ We will force\nthem into a harsh torment. 25. And if you ask them who created the heavens\nand the earth, they will definitely say, “Allah!” Say, “Praise be to Allah!” In\nfact, most of them do not know.\nAllah’s Infinite Knowledge\n26. To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Allah is truly\nthe Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. 27. If all the trees on earth were pens and\nthe ocean ˹were ink˺, refilled by seven other oceans, the Words of Allah\nwould not be exhausted. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.\nAllah’s Infinite Power\n28. The creation and resurrection of you ˹all˺ is as simple ˹for Him˺ as that\nof a single soul. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. 29. Do you not see\nthat Allah causes the night to merge into the day and the day into the night,\nand has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed\nterm, and that Allah is All-Aware of what you do? 30. That is because Allah\n˹alone˺ is the Truth and what they invoke besides Him is falsehood, and\n˹because˺ Allah ˹alone˺ is the Most High, All-Great.\nHuman Ingratitude\n31. Do you not see that the ships sail ˹smoothly˺ through the sea by the\ngrace of Allah so that He may show you some of His signs? Surely in this\nare signs for whoever is steadfast, grateful. 32. And as soon as they are\n\n-- 360 of 694 --\n\noverwhelmed by waves like mountains, they cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in\nsincere devotion. But when He delivers them ˹safely˺ to shore, only some\nbecome relatively grateful. And none rejects Our signs except whoever is\ndeceitful, ungrateful.\nWarning of Judgment Day\n33. O humanity! Be mindful of your Lord, and beware of a Day when no\nparent will be of any benefit to their child, nor will a child be of any benefit\nto their parent. Surely Allah’s promise is true. So do not let the life of this\nworld deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver[836] deceive you about Allah.\nThe Five Keys of the Unseen[837]\n34. Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ has the knowledge of the Hour. He sends down the\nrain,[838] and knows what is in the wombs.[839] No soul knows what it will\nearn for tomorrow, and no soul knows in what land it will die. Surely Allah\nis All-Knowing, All-Aware.\n***\n\n-- 361 of 694 --\n\n32. The Prostration\n(As-Sajdah)\nThis Meccan sûrah, which takes its name from the prostrations of the\nbelievers in worship mentioned in verse 15, makes it clear that the Quran is\na divine revelation and that Almighty Allah is the sole Creator, most\ncapable of resurrection. Similar to the previous sûrah, a reference is made\nto the qualities of the believers and the disbelievers and the reward\nawaiting each. Both the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next urge\nthe Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to turn away from the deniers and not yield to them.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nReassuring the Prophet\n1. Alif-Lãm-Mĩm. 2. The revelation of this Book is—beyond doubt—from\nthe Lord of all worlds. 3. Or do they say, “He has fabricated it!”? No! It is\nthe truth from your Lord in order for you to warn a people to whom no\nwarner has come before you, so they may be ˹rightly˺ guided.\nAllah’s Power of Creation\n4. It is Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth and everything in\nbetween in six Days,[840] then established Himself on the Throne. You have\nno protector or intercessor besides Him. Will you not then be mindful? 5.\nHe conducts every affair from the heavens to the earth, then it all ascends to\nHim on a Day whose length is a thousand years by your counting. 6. That is\nthe Knower of the seen and unseen—the Almighty, Most Merciful, 7. Who\nhas perfected everything He created. And He originated the creation of\nhumankind from clay.[841] 8. Then He made his descendants from an extract\nof a humble fluid, 9. then He fashioned them and had a spirit of His Own\n˹creation˺ breathed into them. And He gave you hearing, sight, and intellect.\n˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks.\nThe Deniers of Resurrection\n10. ˹Still˺ they ask ˹mockingly˺, “When we are disintegrated into the earth,\nwill we really be raised as a new creation?” In fact, they are in denial of the\nmeeting with their Lord. 11. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Your soul will be taken by\n\n-- 362 of 694 --\n\nthe Angel of Death, who is in charge of you. Then to your Lord you will\n˹all˺ be returned.” 12. If only you could see the wicked hanging their heads\n˹in shame˺ before their Lord, ˹crying:˺ “Our Lord! We have now seen and\nheard, so send us back and we will do good. We truly have sure faith\n˹now˺!” 13. Had We willed, We could have easily imposed guidance on\nevery soul. But My Word will come to pass: I will surely fill up Hell with\njinn and humans all together. 14. So taste ˹the punishment˺ for neglecting\nthe meeting of this Day of yours. We ˹too˺ will certainly neglect you. And\ntaste the torment of eternity for what you used to do!\nQualities of the Believers\n15. The only ˹true˺ believers in Our revelation are those who—when it is\nrecited to them—fall into prostration and glorify the praises of their Lord\nand are not too proud. 16. They abandon their beds, invoking their Lord\nwith hope and fear, and donate from what We have provided for them. 17.\nNo soul can imagine what delights are kept in store for them as a reward for\nwhat they used to do.\nThe Faithful and the Rebellious\n18. Is the one who is a believer equal ˹before Allah˺ to the one who is\nrebellious? They are not equal! 19. As for those who believe and do good,\nthey will have the Gardens of ˹Eternal˺ Residence—as an accommodation\nfor what they used to do. 20. But as for those who are rebellious, the Fire\nwill be their home. Whenever they try to escape from it, they will be forced\nback into it, and will be told, “Taste the Fire’s torment, which you used to\ndeny.” 21. We will certainly make them taste some of the minor torment ˹in\nthis life˺ before the major torment ˹of the Hereafter˺, so perhaps they will\nreturn ˹to the Right Path˺. 22. And who does more wrong than the one who\nis reminded of Allah’s revelations then turns away from them? We will\nsurely inflict punishment upon the wicked.\nDivine Revelations\n23. Indeed, We gave the Scripture to Moses—so let there be no doubt ˹O\nProphet˺ that you ˹too˺ are receiving revelations—[842]and We made it a\nguide for the Children of Israel. 24. We raised from among them leaders,\n[843] guiding by Our command, when they patiently endured and firmly\n\n-- 363 of 694 --\n\nbelieved in Our signs. 25. Indeed, your Lord will decide between them on\nthe Day of Judgment regarding their differences.\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n26. Is it not yet clear to them how many peoples We destroyed before them,\nwhose ruins they still pass by? Surely in this are signs. Will they not then\nlisten? 27. Do they not see how We drive rain to parched land, producing\n˹various˺ crops from which they and their cattle eat? Will they not then see?\nThe Deniers of Judgment\n28. They ask ˹mockingly˺, “When is this ˹Day of final˺ Decision, if what\nyou say is true?” 29. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “On the Day of Decision it will not\nbenefit the disbelievers to believe then, nor will they be delayed ˹from\npunishment˺.” 30. So turn away from them, and wait! They too are waiting.\n***\n\n-- 364 of 694 --\n\n33. The Enemy Alliance\n(Al-A\nḥzâb)\nThis Medinian sûrah takes its name from the enemy alliance (mentioned in\nverses 9–27) which laid a siege around Medina during the Battle of the\nTrench in 5 A.H./627 C.E. While the believers are reminded of Allah’s aid\nagainst the enemy alliance, the hypocrites are condemned repeatedly. The\nsûrah provides social guidelines regarding adoption, divorce, modesty, and\nthe etiquette of dealing with the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his wives. In view of\nAllah’s favours to the believers (including His forgiveness and generous\nreward at the end of the sûrah), the next sûrah starts off with praises to\nAllah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nOrders to the Prophet\n1. O Prophet! ˹Always˺ be mindful of Allah, and do not yield to the\ndisbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. 2.\nFollow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Surely Allah is All-Aware\nof what you ˹all˺ do. 3. And put your trust in Allah, for Allah is sufficient as\na Trustee of Affairs.\nRules on Divorce and Adoption[844]\n4. Allah does not place two hearts in any person’s chest. Nor does He\nregard your wives as ˹unlawful for you like˺ your real mothers, ˹even˺ if you\nsay they are.[845] Nor does He regard your adopted children as your real\nchildren.[846] These are only your baseless assertions. But Allah declares the\ntruth, and He ˹alone˺ guides to the ˹Right˺ Way. 5. Let your adopted children\nkeep their family names. That is more just in the sight of Allah. But if you\ndo not know their fathers, then they are ˹simply˺ your fellow believers and\nclose associates. There is no blame on you for what you do by mistake, but\n˹only˺ for what you do intentionally. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful.\nGuidelines for the Believers\n\n-- 365 of 694 --\n\n6. The Prophet has a stronger affinity to the believers than they do\nthemselves. And his wives are their mothers. As ordained by Allah, blood\nrelatives are more entitled ˹to inheritance˺ than ˹other˺ believers and\nimmigrants, unless you ˹want to˺ show kindness to your ˹close˺ associates\n˹through bequest˺.[847] This is decreed in the Record.[848]\nCovenant to Deliver the Truth\n7. And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from the prophets, as well as\nfrom you ˹O Prophet˺, and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, son of\nMary. We did take a solemn covenant from ˹all of˺ them 8. so that He may\nquestion these men of truth about their ˹delivery of the˺ truth. And He has\nprepared a painful punishment for the disbelievers.\nThe Battle of the Trench\n9. O believers! Remember Allah’s favour upon you when ˹enemy˺ forces\ncame to ˹besiege˺ you ˹in Medina˺,[849] so We sent against them a ˹bitter˺\nwind and forces you could not see.[850] And Allah is All-Seeing of what you\ndo. 10. ˹Remember˺ when they came at you from east and west,[851] when\nyour eyes grew wild ˹in horror˺ and your hearts jumped into your throats,\nand you entertained ˹conflicting˺ thoughts about Allah.[852] 11. Then and\nthere the believers were put to the test, and were violently shaken.\nStance of the Hypocrites\n12. And ˹remember˺ when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their\nhearts said, “Allah and His Messenger have promised us nothing but\ndelusion!” 13. And ˹remember˺ when a group of them said, “O people of\nYathrib![853] There is no point in you staying ˹here˺, so retreat!” Another\ngroup of them asked the Prophet’s permission ˹to leave˺, saying, “Our\nhomes are vulnerable,” while ˹in fact˺ they were not vulnerable. They only\nwished to flee. 14. Had their city been sacked from all sides and they had\nbeen asked to abandon faith, they would have done so with little hesitation.\nWarning to the Hypocrites\n15. They had already pledged to Allah earlier never to turn their backs ˹in\nretreat˺. And a pledge to Allah must be answered for. 16. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Fleeing will not benefit you if you ˹try to˺ escape a natural or violent death.\n˹If it is not your time,˺ you will only be allowed enjoyment for a little\nwhile.”[854] 17. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who can put you out of Allah’s\n\n-- 366 of 694 --\n\nreach if He intends to harm you or show you mercy?” They can never find\nany protector or helper besides Allah.\nHypocritical Tactics\n18. Allah knows well those among you who discourage ˹others from\nfighting˺, saying ˹secretly˺ to their brothers, “Stay with us,” and who\nthemselves hardly take part in fighting. 19. ˹They are˺ totally unwilling to\nassist you. When danger comes, you see them staring at you with their eyes\nrolling like someone in the throes of death. But once the danger is over,\nthey slash you with razor-sharp tongues, ravenous for ˹worldly˺ gains. Such\npeople have not ˹truly˺ believed, so Allah has rendered their deeds void.\nAnd that is easy for Allah.\nHypocrites Paranoid\n20. They ˹still˺ think that the enemy alliance has not ˹yet˺ withdrawn. And if\nthe allies were to come ˹again˺, the hypocrites would wish to be away in the\ndesert among nomadic Arabs, ˹only˺ asking for news about you ˹believers˺.\nAnd if the hypocrites were in your midst, they would hardly take part in the\nfight.\nThe Prophet as a Role Model\n21. Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for\nwhoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.\nStance of the Believers\n22. When the believers saw the enemy alliance, they said, “This is what\nAllah and His Messenger had promised us. The promise of Allah and His\nMessenger has come true.” And this only increased them in faith and\nsubmission. 23. Among the believers are men who have proven true to what\nthey pledged to Allah.[855] Some of them have fulfilled their pledge ˹with\ntheir lives˺, others are waiting ˹their turn˺. They have never changed ˹their\ncommitment˺ in the least. 24. ˹It all happened˺ so Allah may reward the\nfaithful for their faithfulness, and punish the hypocrites if He wills or turn\nto them ˹in mercy˺. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nDefeat of the Enemy Alliance\n25. And Allah drove back the disbelievers in their rage, totally empty-\nhanded. And Allah spared the believers from fighting. For Allah is All-\nPowerful, Almighty. 26. And He brought down those from the People of the\n\n-- 367 of 694 --\n\nBook[856] who supported the enemy alliance from their own strongholds,\nand cast horror into their hearts. You ˹believers˺ killed some, and took\nothers captive. 27. He has also caused you to take over their lands, homes,\nand wealth, as well as lands you have not yet set foot on. And Allah is Most\nCapable of everything.\nAdvice to the Prophet’s Wives: Your Choice\n28. O Prophet! Say to your wives, “If you desire the life of this world and\nits luxury, then come, I will give you a ˹suitable˺ compensation ˹for divorce˺\nand let you go graciously. 29. But if you desire Allah and His Messenger\nand the ˹everlasting˺ Home of the Hereafter, then Surely Allah has prepared\na great reward for those of you who do good.”\nMore Advice: Your Reward\n30. O wives of the Prophet! If any of you were to commit a blatant\nmisconduct, the punishment would be doubled for her. And that is easy for\nAllah. 31. And whoever of you devoutly obeys Allah and His Messenger\nand does good, We will grant her double the reward, and We have prepared\nfor her an honourable provision.\nMore Advice: Your Modesty\n32. O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women: if you are\nmindful ˹of Allah˺, then do not be overly effeminate in speech ˹with men˺ or\nthose with sickness in their hearts may be tempted, but speak in a moderate\ntone. 33. Settle in your homes, and do not display yourselves as women did\nin the days of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. Establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and\nobey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only intends to keep ˹the causes of˺\nevil away from you and purify you completely, O members of the\n˹Prophet’s˺ family! 34. ˹Always˺ remember what is recited in your homes of\nAllah’s revelations and ˹prophetic˺ wisdom.[857] Surely Allah is Most\nSubtle, All-Aware.\nReward of the Righteous\n35. Surely ˹for˺ Muslim men and women, believing men and women,[858]\ndevout men and women, truthful men and women, patient men and women,\nhumble men and women, charitable men and women, fasting men and\nwomen, men and women who guard their chastity, and men and women\n\n-- 368 of 694 --\n\nwho remember Allah often—for ˹all of˺ them Allah has prepared\nforgiveness and a great reward.\nUnconditional Obedience\n36. It is not for a believing man or woman—when Allah and His Messenger\ndecree a matter—to have any other choice in that matter.[859] Indeed,\nwhoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has clearly gone ˹far˺ astray.\nThe Case of Zaid\n37. And ˹remember, O Prophet,˺ when you said to the one[860] for whom\nAllah has done a favour and you ˹too˺ have done a favour,[861] “Keep your\nwife and fear Allah,” while concealing within yourself what Allah was\ngoing to reveal. And ˹so˺ you were considering the people, whereas Allah\nwas more worthy of your consideration. So when Zaid totally lost interest in\n˹keeping˺ his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be\nno blame on the believers for marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons\nafter their divorce. And Allah’s command is totally binding. 38. There is no\nblame on the Prophet for doing what Allah has ordained for him. That has\nbeen the way of Allah with those ˹prophets˺ who had gone before. And\nAllah’s command has been firmly decreed. 39. ˹That is His way with˺ those\n˹prophets˺ who deliver the messages of Allah, and consider Him, and none\nbut Allah. And sufficient is Allah as a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner. 40. Muḥammad\nis not the father of any of your men,[862] but is the Messenger of Allah and\nthe seal of the prophets. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.\nReward of the Believers\n41. O believers! Always remember Allah often, 42. and glorify Him\nmorning and evening. 43. He is the One Who showers His blessings upon\nyou—and His angels pray for you—so that He may bring you out of\ndarkness and into light. For He is ever Merciful to the believers. 44. Their\ngreeting on the Day they meet Him will be, “Peace!” And He has prepared\nfor them an honourable reward.\nExcellence of the Prophet\n45. O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness, and a deliverer of good\nnews, and a warner, 46. and a caller to ˹the Way of˺ Allah by His command,\nand a beacon of light. 47. Give good news to the believers that they will\nhave a great bounty from Allah. 48. Do not yield to the disbelievers and the\n\n-- 369 of 694 --\n\nhypocrites. Overlook their annoyances, and put your trust in Allah. For\nAllah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.\nDivorce Before Consummation\n49. O believers! If you marry believing women and then divorce them\nbefore you touch them,[863] they will have no waiting period for you to\ncount,[864] so give them a ˹suitable˺ compensation, and let them go\ngraciously.\nWomen Lawful to the Prophet\n50. O Prophet! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have\npaid their ˹full˺ dowries as well as those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession,\nwhom Allah has granted you.[865] And ˹you are allowed to marry˺ the\ndaughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of your\nmaternal uncles and aunts, who have emigrated like you. Also ˹allowed for\nmarriage is˺ a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet ˹without\ndowry˺ if he is interested in marrying her—˹this is˺ exclusively for you, not\nfor the rest of the believers.[866] We know well what ˹rulings˺ We have\nordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those ˹bondwomen˺\nin their possession. As such, there would be no blame on you. And Allah is\nAll-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nProphet’s Visitation to His Wives\n51. It is up to you ˹O Prophet˺ to delay or receive whoever you please of\nyour wives. There is no blame on you if you call back any of those you\nhave set aside.[867] That is more likely that they will be content, not grieved,\nand satisfied with what you offer them all. Allah ˹fully˺ knows what is in\nyour hearts. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.\nNo Future Marriages\n52. It is not lawful for you ˹O Prophet˺ to marry more women after this, nor\ncan you replace any of your present wives with another, even if her beauty\nmay attract you—except those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession. And Allah\nis ever Watchful over all things.\nOn Visiting the Prophet\n53. O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission\n˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal\nis ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. Once you have eaten,\n\n-- 370 of 694 --\n\nthen go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly\nannoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is\nnever shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for\nsomething, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and\ntheirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever\nmarry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the\nsight of Allah. 54. Whether you reveal something or conceal it, surely Allah\nhas ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. 55. There is no blame on the\nProphet’s wives ˹if they appear unveiled˺ before their fathers,[868] their sons,\ntheir brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their fellow ˹Muslim˺\nwomen, and those ˹bondspeople˺ in their possession. And be mindful of\nAllah ˹O wives of the Prophet!˺ Surely Allah is a Witness over all things.\nBlessings on the Prophet\n56. Indeed, Allah showers His blessings upon the Prophet, and His angels\npray for him. O believers! Invoke Allah’s blessings upon him, and salute\nhim with worthy greetings of peace.\nOffending Allah, His Messenger, and the Believers\n57. Surely those who offend Allah[869] and His Messenger[870] are\ncondemned by Allah in this world and the Hereafter. And He has prepared\nfor them a humiliating punishment. 58. As for those who abuse believing\nmen and women[871] unjustifiably, they will definitely bear the guilt of\nslander and blatant sin.\nThe Veil\n59. O Prophet! Ask your wives, daughters, and believing women to draw\ntheir cloaks over their bodies. In this way it is more likely that they will be\nrecognized ˹as virtuous˺ and not be harassed. And Allah is All-Forgiving,\nMost Merciful.[872]\nReward of the Wicked\n60. If the hypocrites, and those with sickness in their hearts, and rumour-\nmongers in Medina do not desist, We will certainly incite you ˹O Prophet˺\nagainst them, and then they will not be your neighbours there any longer.\n61. ˹They deserve to be˺ condemned. ˹If they were to persist,˺ they would\nget themselves seized and killed relentlessly wherever they are found![873]\n\n-- 371 of 694 --\n\n62. That was Allah’s way with those ˹hypocrites˺ who have gone before.\nAnd you will find no change in Allah’s way.\nWhen Is the Hour?\n63. People ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the Hour. Say, “That knowledge is\nonly with Allah. You never know, perhaps the Hour is near.”\nThe Doomed\n64. Surely Allah condemns the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a\nblazing Fire, 65. to stay there for ever and ever—never will they find any\nprotector or helper. 66. On the Day their faces are ˹constantly˺ flipped in the\nFire, they will cry, “Oh! If only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the\nMessenger!” 67. And they will say, “Our Lord! We obeyed our leaders and\nelite, but they led us astray from the ˹Right˺ Way. 68. Our Lord! Give them\ndouble ˹our˺ punishment, and condemn them tremendously.”\nAdvice to the Believers\n69. O believers! Do not be like those who slandered Moses, but Allah\ncleared him of what they said. And he was honourable in the sight of Allah.\n[874] 70. O believers! Be mindful of Allah, and say what is right. 71. He will\nbless your deeds for you, and forgive your sins. And whoever obeys Allah\nand His Messenger, has truly achieved a great triumph.\nThe Trust[875]\n72. Indeed, We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the\nmountains, but they ˹all˺ declined to bear it, being fearful of it. But\nhumanity assumed it, ˹for˺ they are truly wrongful ˹to themselves˺ and\nignorant ˹of the consequences˺, 73. so that Allah will punish hypocrite men\nand women and polytheistic men and women, and Allah will turn in mercy\nto believing men and women. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n[876]\n***\n\n-- 372 of 694 --\n\n34. Sheba\n(Saba')\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the reference to the people of Sheba\n(verses 15-20) who were punished for meeting Allah’s favours with\ningratitude. Both David (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and Solomon (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) are cited as\ngrateful servants of Allah. The Meccan pagans are reminded that only faith\ncan bring them closer to Allah, not their wealth. They are criticized for\ncalling the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) ‘insane’ and are warned of punishment in this\nlife and the next. Both the last part of this sûrah (verses 40-41) and the\nbeginning of the next (verse 1) reaffirm the angels as Allah’s faithful\nservants.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nPraises to the Almighty\n1. All praise is for Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and\nwhatever is on the earth. And praise be to Him in the Hereafter. He is the\nAll-Wise, All-Aware. 2. He knows whatever goes into the earth and\nwhatever comes out of it, and whatever descends from the sky and whatever\nascends into it. And He is the Most Merciful, All-Forgiving.\nDenying the Hour\n3. The disbelievers say, “The Hour will never come to us.” Say, ˹O\nProphet,˺ “Yes—by my Lord, the Knower of the unseen—it will certainly\ncome to you!” Not ˹even˺ an atom’s weight is hidden from Him in the\nheavens or the earth; nor anything smaller or larger than that, but is\n˹written˺ in a perfect Record.[877] 4. So He may reward those who believe\nand do good. It is they who will have forgiveness and an honourable\nprovision. 5. As for those who strive to discredit Our revelations, it is they\nwho will suffer the ˹worst˺ torment of agonizing pain. 6. Those gifted with\nknowledge ˹clearly˺ see that what has been revealed to you from your Lord\n˹O Prophet˺ is the truth, and that it guides to the Path of the Almighty, the\nPraiseworthy.\nWarning to the Deniers\n\n-- 373 of 694 --\n\n7. The disbelievers say ˹mockingly to one another˺, “Shall we show you a\nman who claims that when you have been utterly disintegrated you will be\nraised as a new creation? 8. Has he fabricated a lie against Allah or is he\ninsane?” In fact, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are bound for\ntorment and have strayed farthest ˹from the truth˺. 9. Have they not then\nseen all that surrounds them of the heavens and the earth? If We willed, We\ncould cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause ˹deadly˺ pieces of the\nsky to fall upon them. Surely in this is a sign for every servant who turns ˹to\nAllah˺.\nAllah’s Favours to David\n10. Indeed, We granted David a ˹great˺ privilege from Us, ˹commanding:˺\n“O mountains! Echo his hymns! And the birds as well.” We made iron\nmouldable for him, 11. instructing: “Make full-length armour, ˹perfectly˺\nbalancing the links. And work righteousness ˹O family of David!˺. Indeed, I\nam All-Seeing of what you do.”\nAllah’s Favours to Solomon\n12. And to Solomon ˹We subjected˺ the wind: its morning stride was a\nmonth’s journey and so was its evening stride. And We caused a stream of\nmolten copper to flow for him, and ˹We subjected˺ some of the jinn to work\nunder him by his Lord’s Will. And whoever of them deviated from Our\ncommand, We made them taste the torment of the blaze. 13. They made for\nhim whatever he desired of sanctuaries, statues,[878] basins as large as\nreservoirs, and cooking pots fixed ˹into the ground˺. ˹We ordered:˺ “Work\ngratefully, O family of David!” ˹Only˺ a few of My servants are ˹truly˺\ngrateful. 14. When We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing indicated to the\n˹subjected˺ jinn that he was dead except the termites eating away his staff.\n[879] So when he collapsed, the jinn realized that if they had ˹really˺ known\nthe unseen, they would not have remained in ˹such˺ humiliating servitude.\nAllah’s Favours to Sheba 1) Provision\n15. Indeed, there was a sign for ˹the tribe of˺ Sheba in their homeland: two\norchards—one to the right and the other to the left. ˹They were told:˺ “Eat\nfrom the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him. ˹Yours is˺ a good\nland and a forgiving Lord.” 16. But they turned away. So We sent against\nthem a devastating flood, and replaced their orchards with two others\n\n-- 374 of 694 --\n\nproducing bitter fruit, fruitless bushes,[880] and a few ˹sparse˺ thorny trees.\n[881] 17. This is how We rewarded them for their ingratitude. Would We\never punish ˹anyone in such a way˺ except the ungrateful?\nAllah’s Favours to Sheba 2) Safe Travel\n18. We had also placed between them and the cities[882] We showered with\nblessings ˹many small˺ towns within sight of one another. And We set\nmoderate travel distances in between, ˹saying,˺ “Travel between them by\nday and night safely.” 19. But they said, “Our Lord! Make ˹the distances of˺\nour journeys longer,” wronging themselves.[883] So We reduced them to\n˹cautionary˺ tales, and scattered them utterly. Surely in this are lessons for\nwhoever is steadfast, grateful.\nSatan’s Vow Regarding Humans\n20. Indeed, Iblîs’ assumption about them has come true,[884] so they ˹all˺\nfollow him, except a group of ˹true˺ believers. 21. He does not have any\nauthority over them, but ˹Our Will is˺ only to distinguish those who believe\nin the Hereafter from those who are in doubt about it. And your Lord is a\n˹vigilant˺ Keeper over all things.”\nHelpless Idols\n22. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon those you claim ˹to be divine˺ besides\nAllah. They do not possess ˹even˺ an atom’s weight either in the heavens or\nthe earth, nor do they have any share in ˹governing˺ them. Nor is any of\nthem a helper to Him.” 23. No intercession will be of any benefit with Him,\nexcept by those granted permission by Him. ˹At last,˺ when the dread ˹of\nJudgment Day˺ is relieved from their hearts ˹because they are permitted to\nintercede˺, they will ˹excitedly˺ ask ˹the angels˺, “What has your Lord ˹just˺\nsaid?” The angels will reply, “The truth! And He is the Most High, All-\nGreat.”\nMessage to the Polytheists\n24. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from the heavens and\nthe earth?” Say, “Allah! Now, certainly one of our two groups[885] is\n˹rightly˺ guided; the other is clearly astray.” 25. Say, “You will not be\naccountable for our misdeeds, nor will we be accountable for your deeds.”\n26. Say, “Our Lord will gather us together, then He will judge between us\nwith the truth. For He is the All-Knowing Judge.” 27. Say, “Show me those\n\n-- 375 of 694 --\n\n˹idols˺ you have joined with Him as partners. No! In fact, He ˹alone˺ is\nAllah—the Almighty, All-Wise.”\nWarning of the Hour\n28. We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a deliverer of good news and a\nwarner to all of humanity, but most people do not know. 29. And they ask\n˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is\ntrue?” 30. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “A Day has ˹already˺ been appointed for you,\nwhich you can neither delay nor advance by a ˹single˺ moment.”\nThe Misleaders and the Misled\n31. The disbelievers vow, “We will never believe in this Quran, nor in those\n˹Scriptures˺ before it.” If only you could see when the wrongdoers will be\ndetained before their Lord, throwing blame at each other! The lowly\n˹followers˺ will say to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “Had it not been for you, we\nwould certainly have been believers.” 32. The arrogant will respond to the\nlowly, “Did we ever hinder you from guidance after it came to you? In fact,\nyou were wicked ˹on your own˺.” 33. The lowly will say to the arrogant,\n“No! It was your plotting by day and night—when you ordered us to\ndisbelieve in Allah and to set up equals with Him.” They will ˹all˺ hide\n˹their˺ remorse when they see the torment. And We will put shackles around\nthe necks of the disbelievers. Will they be rewarded except for what they\nused to do?\nSpoiled Elite\n34. Whenever We sent a warner to a society, its elite would say, “We truly\nreject what you have been sent with.” 35. Adding, “We are far superior ˹to\nthe believers˺ in wealth and children, and we will never be punished.” 36.\nSay, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives abundant or limited\nprovisions to whoever He wills. But most people do not know.” 37. It is not\nyour wealth or children that bring you closer to Us. But those who believe\nand do good—it is they who will have a multiplied reward for what they\ndid, and they will be secure in ˹elevated˺ mansions. 38. As for those who\nstrive to discredit Our revelations, it is they who will be confined in\npunishment. 39. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives\nabundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. And\nwhatever you spend in charity, He will compensate ˹you˺ for it. For He is\nthe Best Provider.”\n\n-- 376 of 694 --\n\nThe Worshippers and the Worshipped\n40. And ˹consider˺ the Day He will gather them all together, and then ask\nthe angels, “Was it you that these ˹polytheists˺ used to worship?” 41. They\nwill say, “Glory be to You! Our loyalty is to You, not them. In fact, they\n˹only˺ followed the ˹temptations of evil˺ jinn,[886] in whom most of them\nhad faith.” 42. So Today neither of you can benefit or protect each other.\nAnd We will say to the wrongdoers, “Taste the torment of the Fire, which\nyou used to deny.”\nResponse of the Polytheists\n43. When Our clear revelations are recited to them, they say, “This is only a\nman who wishes to hinder you from what your forefathers used to\nworship.” They also say, “This ˹Quran˺ is no more than a fabricated lie.”\nAnd the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is\nnothing but pure magic.” 44. ˹They say so even though˺ We had never given\nthem any scriptures to study, nor did We ever send them a warner before\nyou ˹O Prophet˺. 45. Those ˹destroyed˺ before them denied as well—and\nthese ˹Meccans˺ have not attained even one-tenth of what We had given\ntheir predecessors.[887] Yet ˹when˺ they denied My messengers, how severe\nwas My response!\nAdvice to Meccan Pagans\n46. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I advise you to do ˹only˺ one thing: stand up for ˹the\nsake of˺ Allah—individually or in pairs—then reflect. Your fellow man[888]\nis not insane. He is only a warner to you before ˹the coming of˺ a severe\npunishment.” 47. Say, “If I had ever asked you for a reward, you could keep\nit. My reward is only from Allah. And He is a Witness over all things.” 48.\nSay, “Surely my Lord hurls the truth ˹against falsehood˺. ˹He is˺ the Knower\nof all unseen.” 49. Say, “The truth has come, and falsehood will vanish,\nnever to return.” 50. Say, “If I am astray, the loss is only mine. And if I am\nguided, it is ˹only˺ because of what my Lord reveals to me. He is indeed\nAll-Hearing, Ever Near.”\nToo Late for the Deniers\n51. If only you could see when they will be horrified with no escape ˹on\nJudgment Day˺! And they will be seized from a nearby place.[889] 52. They\nwill ˹then˺ cry, “We do ˹now˺ believe in it ˹all˺.” But how could they\n\n-- 377 of 694 --\n\n˹possibly˺ attain faith from a place so far-off ˹from the world˺,[890] 53. while\nthey had already rejected it before, guessing blindly from a place ˹equally˺\nfar-away ˹from the Hereafter˺? 54. They will be sealed off from whatever\nthey desire, as was done to their counterparts before. Indeed, they were ˹all˺\nin alarming doubt.\n***\n\n-- 378 of 694 --\n\n35. The Originator\n(Fâ\nṭir)\nThis Meccan sûrah demonstrates Allah’s infinite power through the marvels\nof His creation, in contrast with the powerlessness of the pagan idols. The\nProphet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is consoled by the fact that many prophets were denied\nbefore him. The believers are promised of a great reward in Paradise\n(verses 31-35), while the disbelievers are warned of a scathing punishment\nin Hell (verses 36-39). All these themes are echoed in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Power 1) Creation and Mercy\n1. All praise is for Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who\nmade angels ˹as His˺ messengers with wings—two, three, or four. He\nincreases in creation whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of\neverything. 2. Whatever mercy Allah opens up for people, none can\nwithhold it. And whatever He withholds, none but Him can release it. For\nHe is the Almighty, All-Wise.\nOne God Only\n3. O humanity! Remember Allah’s favours upon you. Is there any creator\nother than Allah who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?\nThere is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be\ndeluded ˹from the truth˺?\nReassuring the Prophet\n4. If you are rejected by them, so too were messengers before you. And to\nAllah ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺.\nWarning Against Satan\n5. O humanity! Indeed, Allah’s promise is true. So do not let the life of this\nworld deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver[891] deceive you about Allah.\n6. Surely Satan is an enemy to you, so take him as an enemy. He only\ninvites his followers to become inmates of the Blaze.\nThe Evildoers and the Good-Doers\n\n-- 379 of 694 --\n\n7. Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment. But those who\nbelieve and do good will have forgiveness and a great reward. 8. Are those\nwhose evil-doing is made so appealing to them that they deem it good ˹like\nthose who are rightly guided˺? ˹It is˺ certainly Allah ˹Who˺ leaves to stray\nwhoever He wills, and guides whoever He wills. So do not grieve yourself\nto death over them ˹O Prophet˺. Surely Allah is All-Knowing of what they\ndo.\nAllah’s Power 2) The Wind\n9. And it is Allah Who sends the winds, which then stir up ˹vapour,\nforming˺ clouds, and then We drive them to a lifeless land, giving life to the\nearth after its death. Similar is the Resurrection.\nAll Honour and Power Belongs to Allah\n10. Whoever seeks honour and power, then ˹let them know that˺ all honour\nand power belongs to Allah. To Him ˹alone˺ good words ascend, and\nrighteous deeds are raised up by Him. As for those who plot evil, they will\nsuffer a severe punishment. And the plotting of such ˹people˺ is doomed ˹to\nfail˺.\nAllah’s Power 3) Creation of Humans\n11. And ˹it is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ created you from dust,[892] then ˹developed you˺\nfrom a sperm-drop, then made you into pairs.[893] No female ever conceives\nor delivers without His knowledge. And no one’s life is made long or cut\nshort but is ˹written˺ in a Record.[894] That is certainly easy for Allah.\nAllah’s Power 4) Fresh and Salt Water\n12. The two bodies of water are not alike: one is fresh, palatable, and\npleasant to drink and the other is salty and bitter. Yet from them both you\neat tender seafood and extract ornaments to wear. And you see the ships\nploughing their way through both, so you may seek His bounty and give\nthanks ˹to Him˺.\nAllah’s Power 5) Alternation of Day and Night\n13. He merges the night into the day and the day into the night, and has\nsubjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. That is\nAllah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. But those ˹idols˺ you\n˹pagans˺ invoke besides Him do not possess even the skin of a date stone.\n14. If you call upon them, they cannot hear your calls. And if they were to\n\n-- 380 of 694 --\n\nhear, they could not respond to you. On the Day of Judgment they will\ndisown your worship ˹of them˺. And no one can inform you ˹O Prophet˺ like\nthe All-Knowledgeable.\nAllah’s Power 6) Sustenance\n15. O humanity! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah ˹alone˺ is\nthe Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. 16. If He willed, He could eliminate you\nand produce a new creation. 17. And that is not difficult for Allah ˹at all˺.\nEveryone Is Accountable for Themselves\n18. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. And if a sin-\nburdened soul cries for help with its burden, none of it will be carried—\neven by a close relative. You ˹O Prophet˺ can only warn those who stand in\nawe of their Lord without seeing Him[895] and establish prayer. Whoever\npurifies themselves, they only do so for their own good. And to Allah is the\nfinal return.\nGuidance vs. Misguidance\n19. Those blind ˹to the truth˺ and those who can see are not equal, 20. nor\nare the darkness and the light, 21. nor the ˹scorching˺ heat and the ˹cool˺\nshade.[896] 22. Nor are the dead and the living equal. Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺\nmakes whoever He wills hear, but you ˹O Prophet˺ can never make those in\nthe graves hear ˹your call˺.\nReassuring the Prophet\n23. You are only a warner. 24. We have surely sent you with the truth as a\ndeliverer of good news and a warner. There is no community that has not\nhad a warner.[897] 25. If they deny you, so did those before them. Their\nmessengers came to them with clear proofs, divine Books, and enlightening\nScriptures.[898] 26. Then I seized those who persisted in disbelief. How\nsevere was My response!\nAllah’s Power 7) Diversity\n27. Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky with which We\nbring forth fruits of different colours? And in the mountains are streaks of\nvarying shades of white, red, and raven black; 28. just as people, living\nbeings, and cattle are of various colours as well. Of all of Allah’s servants,\nonly the knowledgeable ˹of His might˺ are ˹truly˺ in awe of Him. Allah is\nindeed Almighty, All-Forgiving.\n\n-- 381 of 694 --\n\nThe Everlasting Reward\n29. Surely those who recite the Book of Allah, establish prayer, and donate\nfrom what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—˹can˺ hope\nfor an exchange that will never fail, 30. so that He will reward them in full\nand increase them out of His grace. He is truly All-Forgiving, Most\nAppreciative.\nThree Types of Believers\n31. The Book We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth, confirming\nwhat came before it.[899] Surely Allah is All-Aware, All-Seeing of His\nservants. 32. Then We granted the Book to those We have chosen from Our\nservants. Some of them wrong themselves, some follow a middle course,\nand some are foremost in good deeds by Allah’s Will. That is ˹truly˺ the\ngreatest bounty.\nReward of the Believers\n33. They will enter the Gardens of Eternity, where they will be adorned\nwith bracelets of gold and pearls, and their clothing will be silk. 34. And\nthey will say, “Praise be to Allah, Who has kept away from us all ˹causes\nof˺ sorrow. Our Lord is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative. 35. ˹He is\nthe One˺ Who—out of His grace—has settled us in the Home of Everlasting\nStay, where we will be touched by neither fatigue nor weariness.”\nPunishment of the Disbelievers\n36. As for the disbelievers, they will have the Fire of Hell, where they will\nnot be ˹allowed to be˺ finished by death, nor will its torment be lightened\nfor them. This is how We reward every ˹stubborn˺ disbeliever. 37. There\nthey will be ˹fervently˺ screaming, “Our Lord! Take us out ˹and send us\nback˺. We will do good, unlike what we used to do.” ˹They will be told,˺\n“Did We not give you lives long enough so that whoever wanted to be\nmindful could have done so? And the warner came to you. So taste ˹the\npunishment˺, for the wrongdoers have no helper.”\nDenying the Almighty\n38. Indeed, Allah is the Knower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth.\nHe surely knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. 39. He is the One Who\nhas placed you as successors on earth. So whoever disbelieves will bear ˹the\nburden of˺ their own disbelief. The disbelievers’ denial only increases them\n\n-- 382 of 694 --\n\nin contempt in the sight of their Lord, and it will only contribute to their\nloss.\nUseless Idols\n40. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Have you considered your associate-gods\nwhich you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created on\nearth! Or do they have a share in ˹the creation of˺ the heavens? Or have We\ngiven the polytheists a Book, which serves as a clear proof for them? In\nfact, the wrongdoers promise each other nothing but delusion.”\nAllah’s Power 8) Maintaining the Universe\n41. Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ keeps the heavens and the earth from falling apart.\nIf they were to fall apart, none but Him could hold them up. He is truly\nMost Forbearing, All-Forgiving.\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n42. They swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a warner were to\ncome to them, they would certainly be better guided than any other\ncommunity. Yet when a warner did come to them, it only drove them farther\naway— 43. behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil. But evil\nplotting only backfires on those who plot. Are they awaiting anything but\nthe fate of those ˹destroyed˺ before? You will find no change in the way of\nAllah, nor will you find it diverted ˹to someone else˺. 44. Have they not\ntravelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those ˹destroyed˺\nbefore them? They were far superior in might. But there is nothing that can\nescape Allah in the heavens or the earth. He is certainly All-Knowing, Most\nCapable.\nAllowing Time for Repentance\n45. If Allah were to punish people ˹immediately˺ for what they have\ncommitted, He would not have left a single living being on earth. But He\ndelays them for an appointed term. And when their time arrives, then surely\nAllah is All-Seeing of His servants.\n***\n\n-- 383 of 694 --\n\n36. Yâ-Sĩn\n(Yâ-Sĩn)\nThis Meccan sûrah emphasizes the divine nature and purpose of the Quran.\nThe Arab pagans are reminded of the fate of earlier disbelievers and\ncondemned for following Satan, denying the Resurrection, discrediting the\nQuran, and rejecting the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) as ‘a poet.’ Similar to the next\nsûrah, some examples of Allah’s wonders of creation are cited to prove His\nability to bring the dead back to life.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWake-up Call\n1. Yâ-Sĩn. 2. By the Quran, rich in wisdom! 3. You ˹O Prophet˺ are truly one\nof the messengers 4. upon the Straight Path. 5. ˹This is˺ a revelation from\nthe Almighty, Most Merciful, 6. so that you may warn a people whose\nforefathers were not warned, and so are heedless. 7. The decree ˹of torment˺\nhas already been justified against most of them, for they will never believe.\n8. ˹It is as if˺ We have put shackles around their necks up to their chins, so\ntheir heads are forced up, 9. and have placed a barrier before them and a\nbarrier behind them and covered them ˹all˺ up, so they fail to see ˹the truth˺.\nWho Benefits from Reminders\n10. It is the same whether you warn them or not—they will never believe.\n11. You can only warn those who follow the Reminder[900] and are in awe\nof the Most Compassionate without seeing Him.[901] So give them good\nnews of forgiveness and an honourable reward. 12. It is certainly We Who\nresurrect the dead, and write what they send forth and what they leave\nbehind. Everything is listed by Us in a perfect Record.[902]\nThe Three Messengers\n13. Give them an example ˹O Prophet˺ of the residents of a town, when the\nmessengers came to them. 14. We sent them two messengers, but they\nrejected both. So We reinforced ˹the two˺ with a third, and they declared,\n“We have indeed been sent to you ˹as messengers˺.” 15. The people replied,\n“You are only humans like us, and the Most Compassionate has not\n\n-- 384 of 694 --\n\nrevealed anything. You are simply lying!” 16. The messengers responded,\n“Our Lord knows that we have truly been sent to you. 17. And our duty is\nonly to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.” 18. The people replied, “We\ndefinitely see you as a bad omen for us. If you do not desist, we will\ncertainly stone you ˹to death˺ and you will be touched with a painful\npunishment from us.” 19. The messengers said, “Your bad omen lies within\nyourselves. Are you saying this because you are reminded ˹of the truth˺? In\nfact, you are a transgressing people.”\nAn Advocate of the Truth\n20. Then from the farthest end of the city a man came, rushing. He advised,\n“O my people! Follow the messengers. 21. Follow those who ask no reward\nof you, and are ˹rightly˺ guided. 22. And why should I not worship the One\nWho has originated me, and to Whom you will be returned. 23. How could\nI take besides Him other gods whose intercession would not be of any\nbenefit to me, nor could they save me if the Most Compassionate intended\nto harm me? 24. Indeed, I would then be clearly astray. 25. I do believe in\nyour Lord, so listen to me.” 26. ˹But they killed him, then˺ he was told ˹by\nthe angels˺, “Enter Paradise!” He said, “If only my people knew 27. of how\nmy Lord has forgiven me, and made me one of the honourable.”\nThe Wicked Destroyed\n28. We did not send any soldiers from the heavens against his people after\nhis death, nor did We need to. 29. All it took was one ˹mighty˺ blast, and\nthey were extinguished at once. 30. Oh pity, such beings! No messenger\never came to them without being mocked. 31. Have the deniers not\nconsidered how many peoples We destroyed before them who never came\nback to life again? 32. Yet they will all be brought before Us.\nAllah’s Signs 1) the Earth\n33. There is a sign for them in the dead earth: We give it life, producing\ngrain from it for them to eat. 34. And We have placed in it gardens of palm\ntrees and grapevines, and caused springs to gush forth in it, 35. so that they\nmay eat from its fruit, which they had no hand in making. Will they not\nthen give thanks? 36. Glory be to the One Who created all ˹things in˺ pairs\n—˹be it˺ what the earth produces, their genders, or what they do not know!\nAllah’s Signs 2) Night\n\n-- 385 of 694 --\n\n37. There is also a sign for them in the night: We strip from it daylight, then\n—behold!—they are in darkness.\nAllah’s Signs 3) the Sun and the Moon\n38. The sun travels for its fixed term. That is the design of the Almighty,\nAll-Knowing. 39. As for the moon, We have ordained ˹precise˺ phases for\nit, until it ends up like an old, curved palm stalk. 40. It is not for the sun to\ncatch up with the moon,[903] nor does the night outrun the day. Each is\ntravelling in an orbit of their own.\nAllah’s Signs 4) Mercy at Sea\n41. Another sign for them is that We carried their ancestors ˹with Noah˺ in\nthe fully loaded Ark, 42. and created for them similar things to ride in. 43.\nIf We willed, We could drown them: then no one would respond to their\ncries, nor would they be rescued— 44. except by mercy from Us, allowing\nthem enjoyment for a ˹little˺ while.\nStance of the Polytheists\n45. ˹Still they turn away˺ when it is said to them, “Beware of what is ahead\nof you ˹in the Hereafter˺ and what is behind you ˹of destroyed nations˺ so\nyou may be shown mercy.” 46. Whenever a sign comes to them from their\nLord, they turn away from it. 47. And when it is said to them, “Donate from\nwhat Allah has provided for you,” the disbelievers say to the believers,\n“Why should we feed those whom Allah could have fed if He wanted to?\nYou are clearly astray!”\nToo Late for the Deniers\n48. And they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if\nwhat you say is true?” 49. They must be awaiting a single Blast,[904] which\nwill seize them while they are ˹entrenched˺ in ˹worldly˺ disputes. 50. Then\nthey will not be able to make a ˹last˺ will, nor can they return to their own\npeople. 51. The Trumpet will be blown ˹a second time˺, then—behold!—\nthey will rush from the graves to their Lord. 52. They will cry, “Woe to us!\nWho has raised us up from our place of rest? This must be what the Most\nCompassionate warned us of; the messengers told the truth!” 53. It will only\ntake one Blast, then at once they will all be brought before Us. 54. On that\nDay no soul will be wronged in the least, nor will you be rewarded except\nfor what you used to do.\n\n-- 386 of 694 --\n\nReward of the Believers\n55. Indeed, on that Day the residents of Paradise will be busy enjoying\nthemselves. 56. They and their spouses will be in ˹cool˺ shade, reclining on\n˹canopied˺ couches. 57. There they will have fruits and whatever they\ndesire. 58. And “Peace!” will be ˹their˺ greeting from the Merciful Lord.\nReward of the Disbelievers\n59. ˹Then the disbelievers will be told,˺ “Step away ˹from the believers˺ this\nDay, O wicked ones! 60. Did I not command you, O Children of Adam, not\nto follow Satan, for he is truly your sworn enemy, 61. but to worship Me\n˹alone˺? This is the Straight Path. 62. Yet he already misled great multitudes\nof you. Did you not have any sense? 63. This is the Hell you were warned\nof. 64. Burn in it Today for your disbelief.” 65. On this Day We will seal\ntheir mouths, their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify to what\nthey used to commit.\nAllah’s Power over the Deniers\n66. Had We willed, We could have easily blinded their eyes, so they would\nstruggle to find their way. How then could they see? 67. And had We\nwilled, We could have transfigured them on the spot,[905] so they could\nneither progress forward nor turn back. 68. And whoever We grant a long\nlife, We reverse them in development.[906] Will they not then understand?\nThe Prophet Is Not a Poet\n69. We have not taught him poetry, nor is it fitting for him. This ˹Book˺ is\nonly a Reminder and a clear Quran 70. to warn whoever is ˹truly˺ alive and\nfulfil the decree ˹of torment˺ against the disbelievers.\nAllah’s Signs 5) Domesticated Animals\n71. Do they not see that We singlehandedly[907] created for them, among\nother things, cattle which are under their control? 72. And We have\nsubjected these ˹animals˺ to them, so they may ride some and eat others. 73.\nAnd they derive from them other benefits and drinks. Will they not then\ngive thanks?\nIngratitude of the Deniers\n74. Still they have taken other gods besides Allah, hoping to be helped ˹by\nthem˺. 75. They cannot help the pagans, even though they serve the idols as\n\n-- 387 of 694 --\n\ndedicated guards.[908] 76. So do not let their words grieve you ˹O Prophet˺.\nIndeed, We ˹fully˺ know what they conceal and what they reveal.\nAllah’s Power to Resurrect\n77. Do people not see that We have created them from a sperm-drop, then—\nbehold!—they openly challenge ˹Us˺? 78. And they argue with Us—\nforgetting they were created—saying, “Who will give life to decayed\nbones?” 79. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “They will be revived by the One Who\nproduced them the first time, for He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of every\ncreated being. 80. ˹He is the One˺ Who gives you fire from green trees, and\n—behold!—you kindle ˹fire˺ from them.[909] 81. Can the One Who created\nthe heavens and the earth not ˹easily˺ resurrect these ˹deniers˺?” Yes ˹He\ncan˺! For He is the Master Creator, All-Knowing. 82. All it takes, when He\nwills something ˹to be˺, is simply to say to it: “Be!” And it is! 83. So glory\nbe to the One in Whose Hands is the authority over all things, and to Whom\n˹alone˺ you will ˹all˺ be returned.\n***\n\n-- 388 of 694 --\n\n37. Those ˹Angels˺ Lined up in Ranks\n(Aṣ-\nṢâffât)\nFor the most part, this Meccan sûrah explains verse 31 from the previous\nsûrah: “Have the deniers not considered how many peoples We destroyed\nbefore them …?”. Hence, several examples of destroyed disbelievers are\ncited here, including the peoples of Noah, Lot, and Elias. Some basic truths\nare emphasized, including the oneness of Allah, the Resurrection, and the\nprophethood of Mu\nḥammad (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). The pagans are criticized for calling\nthe Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) ‘a mad poet’ and for claiming that the angels are\nAllah’s daughters. This sûrah provides more details on the punishment of\nthe disbelievers and the reward of the believers in the Hereafter (verses 19-\n68). In conclusion, the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reassured that Allah’s\nmessengers always prevail.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nOne God Only\n1. By those ˹angels˺ lined up in ranks, 2. and those who diligently drive ˹the\nclouds˺, 3. and those who recite the Reminder! 4. Surely your God is One!\n5. ˹He is˺ the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between,\nand the Lord of all points of sunrise.\nThe Heavens Decorated and Protected\n6. Indeed, We have adorned the lowest heaven with the stars for decoration\n7. and ˹for˺ protection from every rebellious devil. 8. They cannot listen to\nthe highest assembly ˹of angels˺ for they are pelted from every side, 9.\n˹fiercely˺ driven away. And they will suffer an everlasting torment. 10. But\nwhoever manages to stealthily eavesdrop is ˹instantly˺ pursued by a piercing\nflare.\nA Question to Resurrection Deniers\n11. So ask them ˹O Prophet˺, which is harder to create: them or other\nmarvels of Our creation?[910] Indeed, We created them from a sticky clay.\n[911] 12. In fact, you are astonished ˹by their denial˺, while they ridicule\n˹you˺. 13. When they are reminded, they are never mindful. 14. And\n\n-- 389 of 694 --\n\nwhenever they see a sign, they make fun of it, 15. saying, “This is nothing\nbut pure magic. 16. When we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will\nwe really be resurrected? 17. And our forefathers as well?” 18. Say, “Yes!\nAnd you will be fully humbled.”\nThe Deniers After Resurrection\n19. It will only take one Blast,[912] then at once they will see ˹it all˺. 20.\nThey will cry, “Oh, woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment!” 21. ˹They will\nbe told,˺ “This is the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision which you used to deny.” 22.\n˹Allah will say to the angels,˺ “Gather ˹all˺ the wrongdoers along with their\npeers, and whatever they used to worship 23. instead of Allah, then lead\nthem ˹all˺ to the path of Hell. 24. And detain them, for they must be\nquestioned.” 25. ˹Then they will be asked,˺ “What is the matter with you\nthat you can no longer help each other?” 26. In fact, on that Day they will\nbe ˹fully˺ submissive.\nThe Misleaders vs. the Misled\n27. They will turn on each other, throwing blame. 28. The misled will say,\n“It was you who deluded us away from what is right.”[913] 29. The\nmisleaders will reply, “No! You disbelieved on your own. 30. We had no\nauthority over you. In fact, you yourselves were a transgressing people. 31.\nThe decree of our Lord has come to pass against us ˹all˺: we will certainly\ntaste ˹the punishment˺. 32. We caused you to deviate, for we ourselves were\ndeviant.” 33. Surely on that Day they will ˹all˺ share in the punishment.\nWarning to Arab Pagans\n34. That is certainly how We deal with the wicked. 35. For whenever it was\nsaid to them ˹in the world˺, “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except\nAllah,” they acted arrogantly 36. and argued, “Should we really abandon\nour gods for a mad poet?” 37. In fact, he came with the truth, confirming\n˹earlier˺ messengers. 38. You will certainly taste the painful torment, 39.\nand will only be rewarded for what you used to do.\nReward of the Devout\n40. But not the chosen servants of Allah. 41. They will have a known\nprovision: 42. fruits ˹of every type˺.[914] And they will be honoured 43. in\nthe Gardens of Bliss, 44. facing each other on thrones.[915] 45. A drink ˹of\npure wine˺ will be passed around to them from a flowing stream: 46.\n\n-- 390 of 694 --\n\ncrystal-white, delicious to drink. 47. It will neither harm ˹them˺, nor will\nthey be intoxicated by it. 48. And with them will be maidens of modest\ngaze and gorgeous eyes, 49. as if they were pristine pearls.[916]\nThe People of Paradise Chatting\n50. Then they will turn to one another inquisitively.[917] 51. One of them\nwill say, “I once had a companion ˹in the world˺ 52. who used to ask ˹me˺,\n‘Do you actually believe ˹in resurrection˺? 53. When we are dead and\nreduced to dust and bones, will we really be brought to judgment?’” 54. He\nwill ˹then˺ ask, “Would you care to see ˹his fate˺?” 55. Then he ˹and the\nothers˺ will look and spot him in the midst of the Hellfire. 56. He will ˹then˺\nsay, “By Allah! You nearly ruined me. 57. Had it not been for the grace of\nmy Lord, I ˹too˺ would have certainly been among those brought ˹to Hell˺.”\n58. ˹Then he will ask his fellow believers,˺ “Can you imagine that we will\nnever die, 59. except our first death, nor be punished ˹like the others˺?” 60.\nThis is truly the ultimate triumph. 61. For such ˹honour˺ all should strive.\nHospitality for the People of Hell\n62. Is this ˹bliss˺ a better accommodation or the tree of Zaqqûm?[918] 63. We\nhave surely made it a test for the wrongdoers. 64. Indeed, it is a tree that\ngrows in the depths of Hell, 65. bearing fruit like devils’ heads. 66. The\nevildoers will certainly ˹be left to˺ eat from it, filling up their bellies with it.\n67. Then on top of that they will be given a blend of boiling drink. 68. Then\nthey will ultimately return to ˹their place in˺ Hell.\nBlind Following\n69. Indeed, they found their forefathers astray, 70. so they rushed in their\nfootsteps! 71. And surely most of the earlier generations had strayed before\nthem, 72. although We had certainly sent warners among them. 73. See then\nwhat was the end of those who had been warned. 74. But not the chosen\nservants of Allah.\nProphet Noah\n75. Indeed, Noah cried out to Us, and how excellent are We in responding!\n76. We delivered him and his family[919] from the great distress, 77. and\nmade his descendants the sole survivors.[920] 78. And We blessed him ˹with\nhonourable mention˺ among later generations: 79. “Peace be upon Noah\namong all peoples.” 80. Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers. 81.\n\n-- 391 of 694 --\n\n˹For˺ he was truly one of Our faithful servants. 82. Then We drowned the\nothers.\nProphet Abraham\n83. And indeed, one of those who followed his way was Abraham. 84.\n˹Remember˺ when he came to his Lord with a pure heart, 85. and said to his\nfather and his people, “What are you worshipping? 86. Is it false gods that\nyou desire instead of Allah? 87. What then do you expect from the Lord of\nall worlds?” 88. He later looked up to the stars ˹in contemplation˺,[921] 89.\nthen said, “I am really sick.”[922] 90. So they turned their backs on him and\nwent away. 91. Then he ˹stealthily˺ advanced towards their gods, and said\n˹mockingly˺, “Will you not eat ˹your offerings˺? 92. What is wrong with\nyou that you cannot speak?” 93. Then he swiftly turned on them, striking\n˹them˺ with his right hand. 94. Later, his people came rushing towards him\n˹furiously˺. 95. He argued, “How can you worship what you carve ˹with\nyour own hands˺, 96. when it is Allah Who created you and whatever you\ndo?” 97. They said ˹to one another˺, “Build him a furnace and cast him into\nthe blazing fire.” 98. And so they sought to harm him, but We made them\ninferior.\nAbraham, Ishmael and the Sacrifice\n99. He later said, “I am leaving ˹in obedience˺ to my Lord. He will guide\nme. 100. My Lord! Bless me with righteous offspring.” 101. So We gave\nhim good news of a forbearing son. 102. Then when the boy reached the\nage to work with him, Abraham said, “O my dear son! I have seen in a\ndream that I ˹must˺ sacrifice you. So tell me what you think.” He replied,\n“O my dear father! Do as you are commanded. Allah willing, you will find\nme steadfast.” 103. Then when they submitted ˹to Allah’s Will˺, and\nAbraham laid him on the side of his forehead ˹for sacrifice˺, 104. We called\nout to him, “O Abraham! 105. You have already fulfilled the vision.”\nIndeed, this is how We reward the good-doers. 106. That was truly a\nrevealing test. 107. And We ransomed his son with a great sacrifice,[923]\n108. and blessed Abraham ˹with honourable mention˺ among later\ngenerations: 109. “Peace be upon Abraham.” 110. This is how We reward\nthe good-doers. 111. He was truly one of Our faithful servants. 112. We\n˹later˺ gave him good news of Isaac—a prophet, and one of the righteous.\n\n-- 392 of 694 --\n\n[924] 113. We blessed him[925] and Isaac as well. Some of their descendants\ndid good, while others clearly wronged themselves.\nProphet Moses and Prophet Aaron\n114. And We certainly showed favour to Moses and Aaron, 115. and\ndelivered them and their people from the great distress. 116. We helped\nthem so it was they who prevailed. 117. We gave them the clear Scripture,\n118. and guided them to the Straight Path. 119. And We blessed them ˹with\nhonourable mention˺ among later generations: 120. “Peace be upon Moses\nand Aaron.” 121. Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers. 122. They\nwere truly ˹two˺ of Our faithful servants.\nProphet Elias\n123. And Elias was indeed one of the messengers. 124. ˹Remember˺ when\nhe said to his people, “Will you not fear ˹Allah˺? 125. Do you call upon ˹the\nidol of˺ Ba’l and abandon the Best of Creators— 126. Allah, your Lord and\nthe Lord of your forefathers?” 127. But they rejected him, so they will\ncertainly be brought ˹for punishment˺. 128. But not the chosen servants of\nAllah. 129. We blessed him ˹with honourable mention˺ among later\ngenerations: 130. “Peace be upon Elias.” 131. Indeed, this is how We\nreward the good-doers. 132. He was truly one of Our faithful servants.\nProphet Lot\n133. And Lot was indeed one of the messengers. 134. ˹Remember˺ when\nWe delivered him and all of his family, 135. except an old woman,[926] who\nwas one of the doomed. 136. Then We ˹utterly˺ destroyed the rest. 137. You\n˹Meccans˺ certainly pass by their ruins day 138. and night. Will you not\nthen understand?\nProphet Jonah\n139. And Jonah was indeed one of the messengers. 140. ˹Remember˺ when\nhe fled to the overloaded ship. 141. Then ˹to save it from sinking,˺ he drew\nstraws ˹with other passengers˺. He lost ˹and was thrown overboard˺. 142.\nThen the whale engulfed him while he was blameworthy.[927] 143. Had he\nnot ˹constantly˺ glorified ˹Allah˺,[928] 144. he would have certainly\nremained in its belly until the Day of Resurrection.[929] 145. But We cast\nhim onto the open ˹shore˺, ˹totally˺ worn out, 146. and caused a squash plant\nto grow over him.[930] 147. We ˹later˺ sent him ˹back˺ to ˹his city of˺ at least\n\n-- 393 of 694 --\n\none hundred thousand people, 148. who then believed ˹in him˺, so We\nallowed them enjoyment for a while.\nQuestions to Arab Pagans\n149. Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ if your Lord has daughters,[931] while the pagans\n˹prefer to˺ have sons. 150. Or ˹ask them˺ if We created the angels as females\nright before their eyes. 151. Indeed, it is one of their ˹outrageous˺\nfabrications to say, 152. “Allah has children.” They are simply liars. 153.\nHas He chosen daughters over sons?[932] 154. What is the matter with you?\nHow do you judge? 155. Will you not then be mindful? 156. Or do you\nhave ˹any˺ compelling proof? 157. Then bring ˹us˺ your scripture, if what\nyou say is true! 158. They have also established a ˹marital˺ relationship\nbetween Him and the jinn. Yet the jinn ˹themselves˺ know well that such\npeople will certainly be brought ˹for punishment˺.[933] 159. Glorified is\nAllah far above what they claim! 160. But not the chosen servants of Allah.\n161. Surely you ˹pagans˺ and whatever ˹idols˺ you worship 162. can never\nlure ˹anyone˺ away from Him 163. except those ˹destined˺ to burn in Hell.\nAngels’ Response\n164. ˹The angels respond,˺ “There is not one of us without an assigned\nstation ˹of worship˺. 165. We are indeed the ones lined up in ranks ˹for\nAllah˺. 166. And we are indeed the ones ˹constantly˺ glorifying ˹His\npraise˺.”\nThe Pagans Before the Quran\n167. They certainly used to say, 168. “If only we had a Reminder like ˹those\nof˺ earlier peoples,[934] 169. we would have truly been Allah’s devoted\nservants.” 170. But ˹now˺ they reject it, so they will soon know.\nReassuring the Prophet\n171. Our Word has already gone forth to Our servants, the messengers, 172.\nthat they would surely be helped, 173. and that Our forces will certainly\nprevail. 174. So turn away from the deniers for a while ˹O Prophet˺. 175.\nYou will see ˹what will happen to˺ them, and they too will see! 176. Do they\n˹really˺ wish to hasten Our punishment? 177. Yet when it descends upon\nthem:[935] how evil will that morning be for those who had been warned!\n178. And turn away from them for a while. 179. You will see, and they too\nwill see!\n\n-- 394 of 694 --\n\nThe Conclusion\n180. Glorified is your Lord—the Lord of Honour and Power—above what\nthey claim! 181. Peace be upon the messengers. 182. And praise be to Allah\n—Lord of all worlds.\n***\n\n-- 395 of 694 --\n\n38. Ṣãd\n(\nṢãd)\nThis sûrah is perceived as a continuation of the previous sûrah since it\nmentions some prophets that are not mentioned there—such as David,\nSolomon, and Job. Again, the pagans are condemned for denying the\noneness of Allah, rejecting the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) as ‘a magician, a total\nliar,’ and for claiming that the world was created without purpose.\nReference is made to the creation of Adam (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and the enmity Satan\nhas for him and his descendants (verses 71-85), and the punishment\nawaiting the misleaders and their followers (verses 55-64), contrasted with\nthe bliss in store for the righteous (verses 49-54). The end of this sûrah\nemphasizes the universality of the Quran whereas the beginning of the next\nspeaks of its divine nature.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nArab Deniers\n1.\nṢãd. By the Quran, full of reminders! 2. ˹This is the truth,˺ yet the\ndisbelievers are ˹entrenched˺ in arrogance and opposition. 3. ˹Imagine˺ how\nmany peoples We destroyed before them, and they cried out when it was too\nlate to escape. 4. Now, the pagans are astonished that a warner has come to\nthem from among themselves.[936] And the disbelievers say, “This is a\nmagician, a total liar! 5. Has he reduced ˹all˺ the gods to One God? Indeed,\nthis is something totally astonishing.”\nChief Deniers\n6. The chiefs among them went forth saying, “Carry on, and stand firm in\ndevotion to your gods. Certainly this is just a scheme ˹for power˺.[937] 7. We\nhave never heard of this in the previous faith.[938] This is nothing but a\nfabrication. 8. Has the Reminder been revealed ˹only˺ to him out of ˹all of˺\nus?” In fact, they are ˹only˺ in doubt of My ˹revealed˺ Reminder.[939] In fact,\n˹they do so because˺ they have not yet tasted My punishment. 9. Or ˹is it\nbecause˺ they possess the treasuries of the mercy of your Lord—the\nAlmighty, the Giver ˹of all bounties˺. 10. Or ˹is it because˺ the kingdom of\n\n-- 396 of 694 --\n\nthe heavens and the earth and everything in between belongs to them? Let\nthem then climb their way ˹to heaven, if their claim is true˺.\nWarning to the Deniers\n11. This is just another ˹enemy˺ force bound for defeat out there.[940] 12.\nBefore them, the people of Noah denied ˹the truth˺, as did ’Âd, Pharaoh of\nthe mighty structures,[941] 13. Thamûd, the people of Lot, and the residents\nof the Forest.[942] These were ˹all˺ enemy forces. 14. Each rejected their\nmessenger, so My punishment was justified. 15. These ˹pagans˺ are\nawaiting nothing but a single Blast that cannot be stopped. 16. They say\n˹mockingly˺, “Our Lord! Hasten for us our share ˹of the punishment˺ before\nthe Day of Reckoning.”\nProphet David\n17. Be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And remember Our servant,\nDavid, the man of strength. Indeed, he ˹constantly˺ turned ˹to Allah˺. 18. We\ntruly subjected the mountains to hymn ˹Our praises˺ along with him in the\nevening and after sunrise. 19. And ˹We subjected˺ the birds, flocking\ntogether. All turned to him ˹echoing his hymns˺. 20. We strengthened his\nkingship, and gave him wisdom and sound judgment.\nDavid and the Disputing Partners\n21. Has the story of the two plaintiffs, who scaled the ˹wall of David’s˺\nsanctuary, reached you ˹O Prophet˺? 22. When they came into David’s\npresence, he was startled by them. They said, “Have no fear. ˹We are\nmerely˺ two in a dispute: one of us has wronged the other. So judge between\nus with truth—do not go beyond ˹it˺—and guide us to the right way. 23.\nThis is my brother.[943] He has ninety-nine sheep while I have ˹only˺ one.\n˹Still˺ he asked me to give it up to him, overwhelming me with ˹his˺\nargument.” 24. David ˹eventually˺ ruled, “He has definitely wronged you in\ndemanding ˹to add˺ your sheep to his. And certainly many partners wrong\neach other, except those who believe and do good—but how few are they!”\nThen David realized that We had tested him so he asked for his Lord’s\nforgiveness, fell down in prostration, and turned ˹to Him in repentance˺.[944]\n25. So We forgave that for him. And he will indeed have ˹a status of˺\ncloseness to Us and an honourable destination! 26. ˹We instructed him:˺ “O\nDavid! We have surely made you an authority in the land, so judge between\n\n-- 397 of 694 --\n\npeople with truth. And do not follow ˹your˺ desires or they will lead you\nastray from Allah’s Way. Surely those who go astray from Allah’s Way will\nsuffer a severe punishment for neglecting the Day of Reckoning.”\nAllah Is Just\n27. We have not created the heavens and earth and everything in between\nwithout purpose—as the disbelievers think. So woe to the disbelievers\nbecause of the Fire! 28. Or should We treat those who believe and do good\nlike those who make mischief throughout the land? Or should We treat the\nrighteous like the wicked?\nThe Purpose of the Quran\n29. ˹This is˺ a blessed Book which We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ so\nthat they may contemplate its verses, and people of reason may be mindful.\nSolomon’s Love for Fine Horses\n30. And We blessed David with Solomon—what an excellent servant ˹he\nwas˺! Indeed, he ˹constantly˺ turned ˹to Allah˺. 31. ˹Remember˺ when the\nwell-trained, swift horses were paraded before him in the evening. 32. He\nthen proclaimed, “I am truly in love with ˹these˺ fine things out of\nremembrance for Allah,” until they went out of sight. 33. ˹He ordered,˺\n“Bring them back to me!” Then he began to rub down their legs and necks.\n[945]\nSolomon’s Authority\n34. And indeed, We tested Solomon, placing a ˹deformed˺ body on his\nthrone,[946] then he turned ˹to Allah in repentance˺. 35. He prayed, “My\nLord! Forgive me, and grant me an authority that will never be matched by\nanyone after me. You are indeed the Giver ˹of all bounties˺.” 36. So We\nsubjected to him the wind, blowing gently at his command to wherever he\npleased. 37. And ˹We subjected to him˺ every builder and diver[947] of the\njinn, 38. and others bound together in chains. 39. ˹Allah said,˺ “This is Our\ngift, so give or withhold ˹as you wish˺, never to be called to account.” 40.\nAnd he will indeed have ˹a status of˺ closeness to Us and an honourable\ndestination!\nProphet Job\n41. And remember Our servant Job, when he cried out to his Lord, “Satan\nhas afflicted me with distress and suffering.” 42. ˹We responded,˺ “Stomp\n\n-- 398 of 694 --\n\nyour foot: ˹now˺ here is a cool ˹and refreshing˺ spring for washing and\ndrinking.” 43. And We gave him back his family, twice as many, as a mercy\nfrom Us and a lesson for people of reason. 44. ˹And We said to him,˺ “Take\nin your hand a bundle of grass, and strike ˹your wife˺ with it, and do not\nbreak your oath.”[948] We truly found him patient. What an excellent servant\n˹he was˺! Indeed, he ˹constantly˺ turned ˹to Allah˺.\nOther Mighty Prophets\n45. And remember Our servants: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the men of\nstrength and insight. 46. We truly chose them for the honour of proclaiming\nthe Hereafter. 47. And in Our sight they are truly among the chosen and the\nfinest. 48. Also remember Ishmael, Elisha, and Ⱬul-Kifl.[949] All are among\nthe best.\nReward of the Righteous\n49. This is ˹all˺ a reminder. And the righteous will certainly have an\nhonourable destination: 50. the Gardens of Eternity, whose gates will be\nopen for them. 51. There they will recline, calling for abundant fruit and\ndrink. 52. And with them will be maidens of modest gaze and equal age. 53.\nThis is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning. 54. This is indeed\nOur provision that will never end.\nReward of the Wicked\n55. That is that. And the transgressors will certainly have the worst\ndestination: 56. Hell, where they will burn. What an evil place to rest! 57.\nLet them then taste this: boiling water and ˹oozing˺ pus, 58. and other\ntorments of the same sort!\nDisputes of the Wicked\n59. ˹The misleaders will say to one another,˺ “Here is a crowd ˹of followers˺\nbeing thrown in with us. They are not welcome, ˹for˺ they ˹too˺ will burn in\nthe Fire.”[950] 60. The followers will respond, “No! You are not welcome!\nYou brought this upon us. What an evil place for settlement!” 61. Adding,\n“Our Lord! Whoever brought this upon us, double their punishment in the\nFire.” 62. The tyrants will ask ˹one another˺, “But why do we not see those\nwe considered to be lowly? 63. Were we wrong in mocking them ˹in the\nworld˺?[951] Or do our eyes ˹just˺ fail to see them ˹in the Fire˺?” 64. This\ndispute between the residents of the Fire will certainly come to pass.\n\n-- 399 of 694 --\n\nThe Messenger and His Message\n65. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a warner. And there is no god ˹worthy of\nworship˺ except Allah—the One, the Supreme. 66. ˹He is the˺ Lord of the\nheavens and the earth and everything in between—the Almighty, Most\nForgiving.” 67. Say, “This ˹Quran˺ is momentous news, 68. from which you\n˹pagans˺ are turning away.” 69. ˹And say,˺ “I had no knowledge of the\nhighest assembly ˹in heaven˺ when they differed ˹concerning Adam˺.[952]\n70. What is revealed to me is that I am only sent with a clear warning.”\nSatan’s Arrogance\n71. ˹Remember, O Prophet˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going\nto create a human being from clay. 72. So when I have fashioned him and\nhad a spirit of My Own ˹creation˺ breathed into him, fall down in\nprostration to him.” 73. So the angels prostrated all together— 74. but not\nIblîs,[953] who acted arrogantly,[954] becoming unfaithful. 75. Allah asked,\n“O Iblîs! What prevented you from prostrating to what I created with My\nOwn Hands? Did you ˹just˺ become proud? Or have you always been\narrogant?” 76. He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire\nand him from clay.” 77. Allah commanded, “Then get out of Paradise, for\nyou are truly cursed. 78. And surely upon you is My condemnation until the\nDay of Judgment.” 79. Satan appealed, “My Lord! Then delay my end until\nthe Day of their resurrection.” 80. Allah said, “You will be delayed 81. until\nthe appointed Day.” 82. Satan said, “By Your Glory! I will certainly mislead\nthem all, 83. except Your chosen servants among them.” 84. Allah\nconcluded, “The truth is—and I ˹only˺ say the truth—: 85. I will surely fill\nup Hell with you and whoever follows you from among them, all together.”\nMessage to the Deniers\n86. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹Quran˺, nor\ndo I pretend to be someone I am not. 87. It is only a reminder to the whole\nworld. 88. And you will certainly know its truth before long.”\n***\n\n-- 400 of 694 --\n\n39. The ˹Successive˺ Groups\n(Az-Zumar)\nThis Meccan sûrah builds on the story of the creation of Adam in the\nprevious sûrah by referring to the creation of Adam’s spouse, and how their\ndescendants were created in the womb, developing in successive stages.\nSome of those descendants choose to be faithful and grateful to their\nCreator, while others choose not to. Eventually, following a fair judgment,\nthe former will be led to their places in Paradise and the latter to their\nplaces in Hell—each in successive groups (hence the sûrah’s name). Allah’s\nwillingness to forgive sins is highly emphasized in the last part of this sûrah\nand the beginning of the next.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWorship Allah Alone\n1. The revelation of this Book is from Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise. 2.\nIndeed, We have sent down the Book to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth, so\nworship Allah ˹alone˺, being sincerely devoted to Him. 3. Indeed, sincere\ndevotion is due ˹only˺ to Allah. As for those who take other lords besides\nHim, ˹saying,˺ “We worship them only so they may bring us closer to\nAllah,” surely Allah will judge between all[955] regarding what they differed\nabout. Allah certainly does not guide whoever persists in lying and\ndisbelief.\nAllah’s Power of Creation\n4. Had it been Allah’s Will to have offspring, He could have chosen\nwhatever He willed of His creation. Glory be to Him! He is Allah—the\nOne, the Supreme. 5. He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose.\nHe wraps the night around the day, and wraps the day around the night. And\nHe has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term.\nHe is truly the Almighty, Most Forgiving. 6. He created you ˹all˺ from a\nsingle soul,[956] then from it He made its mate.[957] And He produced for\nyou four pairs of cattle.[958] He creates you in the wombs of your mothers\n˹in stages˺, one development after another, in three layers of darkness.[959]\n\n-- 401 of 694 --\n\nThat is Allah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. There is no god\n˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be turned away?\nBelief and Disbelief\n7. If you disbelieve, then ˹know that˺ Allah is truly not in need of you, nor\ndoes He approve of disbelief from His servants. But if you become grateful\n˹through faith˺, He will appreciate that from you. No soul burdened with sin\nwill bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He\nwill inform you of what you used to do. He certainly knows best what is\n˹hidden˺ in the heart.\nDisbelievers’ Ingratitude\n8. When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to\nHim ˹alone˺. But as soon as He showers them with blessings from Him,\nthey ˹totally˺ forget the One they had cried to earlier, and set up equals to\nAllah to mislead ˹others˺ from His Way. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Enjoy your\ndisbelief for a little while! You will certainly be one of the inmates of the\nFire.” 9. ˹Are they better˺ or those who worship ˹their Lord˺ devoutly in the\nhours of the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter and\nhoping for the mercy of their Lord? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Are those who know\nequal to those who do not know?” None will be mindful ˹of this˺ except\npeople of reason.\nOrders to the Prophet\n10. Say ˹O Prophet, that Allah says˺, “O My servants who believe! Be\nmindful of your Lord. Those who do good in this world will have a good\nreward. And Allah’s earth is spacious. Only those who endure patiently will\nbe given their reward without limit.” 11. Say, “I am commanded to worship\nAllah, being sincerely devoted to Him ˹alone˺. 12. And I am commanded to\nbe the first of those who submit ˹to His Will˺.” 13. Say, “I truly fear—if I\nwere to disobey my Lord—the torment of a tremendous Day.” 14. Say, “It is\n˹only˺ Allah that I worship, being sincere in my devotion to Him. 15.\nWorship then whatever ˹gods˺ you want instead of Him.” Say, “The ˹true˺\nlosers are those who will lose themselves and their families on Judgment\nDay. That is indeed the clearest loss.” 16. They will have layers of fire\nabove and below them. That is what Allah warns His servants with. So fear\nMe, O My servants!\n\n-- 402 of 694 --\n\nThe Faithful and the Unfaithful\n17. And those who shun the worship of false gods, turning to Allah ˹alone˺,\nwill have good news. So give good news to My servants ˹O Prophet˺— 18.\nthose who listen to what is said and follow the best of it.[960] These are the\nones ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah, and these are ˹truly˺ the people of reason. 19.\nWhat about those against whom the decree of torment has been justified? Is\nit you ˹O Prophet˺ who will then save those bound for the Fire? 20. But\nthose mindful of their Lord will have ˹elevated˺ mansions, built one above\nthe other, under which rivers flow. ˹That is˺ the promise of Allah. ˹And˺\nAllah never fails in ˹His˺ promise.\nParable for This Fleeting Life\n21. Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky—channelling it\nthrough streams in the earth—then produces with it crops of various\ncolours, then they dry up and you see them wither, and then He reduces\nthem to chaff? Surely in this is a reminder for people of reason.\nThe Believers and the Disbelievers\n22. Can ˹the misguided be like˺ those whose hearts Allah has opened to\nIslam, so they are enlightened by their Lord? So woe to those whose hearts\nare hardened at the remembrance of Allah! It is they who are clearly astray.\nExcellence of the Quran\n23. ˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ has sent down the best message—a Book of perfect\nconsistency and repeated lessons—which causes the skin ˹and hearts˺ of\nthose who fear their Lord to tremble, then their skin and hearts soften at the\nmention of ˹the mercy of˺ Allah. That is the guidance of Allah, through\nwhich He guides whoever He wills. But whoever Allah leaves to stray will\nbe left with no guide. 24. Are those who will only have their ˹bare˺ faces to\nshield themselves from the awful torment on Judgment Day ˹better than\nthose in Paradise˺? It will ˹then˺ be said to the wrongdoers: “Reap what you\nsowed!”\nRejection Leads to Punishment\n25. Those before them ˹also˺ rejected ˹the truth˺, then the torment came\nupon them from where they least expected. 26. So Allah made them taste\nhumiliation in this worldly life, but far worse is the punishment of the\nHereafter, if only they knew.\n\n-- 403 of 694 --\n\nPerfection of the Quran\n27. We have certainly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people in this\nQuran, so perhaps they will be mindful. 28. ˹It is˺ a Quran ˹revealed˺ in\nArabic without any crookedness, so perhaps they will be conscious ˹of\nAllah˺.\nParable for a Polytheist and a Monotheist\n29. Allah sets forth the parable of a slave owned by several quarrelsome\nmasters, and a slave owned by only one master. Are they equal in\ncondition?[961] Praise be to Allah! In fact, most of them do not know.\nAll Will Die\n30. You ˹O Prophet˺ will certainly die, and they will die too. 31. Then on\nthe Day of Judgment you will ˹all settle your˺ dispute before your Lord.\nReward of the Believers and Disbelievers\n32. Who then does more wrong than those who lie about Allah and reject\nthe truth after it has reached them? Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the\ndisbelievers? 33. And the one who has brought the truth and those who\nembrace it—it is they who are the righteous. 34. They will have whatever\nthey desire with their Lord. That is the reward of the good-doers. 35. As\nsuch, Allah will absolve them of ˹even˺ the worst of what they did and\nreward them according to the best of what they used to do.\nAllah Protects His Messenger\n36. Is Allah not sufficient for His servant? Yet they threaten you with other\n˹powerless˺ gods besides Him! Whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left\nwith no guide. 37. And whoever Allah guides, none can lead astray. Is Allah\nnot Almighty, capable of punishment?\nAlmighty Allah or Powerless Gods\n38. If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth, they\nwill certainly say, “Allah!” Ask ˹them˺, “Consider then whatever ˹idols˺ you\ninvoke besides Allah: if it was Allah’s Will to harm me, could they undo\nthat harm? Or if He willed ˹some˺ mercy for me, could they withhold His\nmercy?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me. In Him ˹alone˺ the faithful put\ntheir trust.”\nWarning to the Pagans\n\n-- 404 of 694 --\n\n39. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O my people! Persist in your ways, for I ˹too˺ will\npersist in mine. You will soon come to know 40. who will be visited by a\nhumiliating torment ˹in this life˺ and overwhelmed by an everlasting\npunishment ˹in the next˺.”\nFree Choice\n41. Surely We have revealed to you the Book ˹O Prophet˺ with the truth for\nhumanity. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is for their own good. And\nwhoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. You are not a keeper\nover them.\nSleep: The Twin Brother of Death\n42. ˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ calls back the souls ˹of people˺ upon their death as\nwell as ˹the souls˺ of the living during their sleep. Then He keeps those for\nwhom He has ordained death, and releases the others until ˹their˺ appointed\ntime. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.\nAllah or the Idols\n43. Or have they taken others besides Allah as intercessors? Say, ˹O\nProphet,˺ “˹Would they do so,˺ even though those ˹idols˺ have neither\nauthority nor intelligence?” 44. Say, “All intercession belongs to Allah\n˹alone˺. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Then to\nHim you will ˹all˺ be returned.” 45. Yet when Allah alone is mentioned, the\nhearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are filled with disgust. But\nas soon as those ˹gods˺ other than Him are mentioned, they are filled with\njoy.\nAllah Is the Judge\n46. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O Allah—Originator of the heavens and the earth,\nKnower of the seen and unseen! You will judge between Your servants\nregarding their differences.” 47. Even if the wrongdoers were to possess\neverything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom\nthemselves from the horrible punishment on Judgment Day, for they will\nsee from Allah what they had never expected. 48. And the evil\n˹consequences˺ of their deeds will unfold before them, and they will be\noverwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.\nHuman Ingratitude\n\n-- 405 of 694 --\n\n49. When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to Us ˹alone˺. Then\nwhen We shower Our blessings upon them, they say, “I have been granted\nall this only because of ˹my˺ knowledge.” Not at all! It is ˹no more than˺ a\ntest. But most of them do not know. 50. The same had already been said by\nthose ˹destroyed˺ before them,[962] but their ˹worldly˺ gains were of no\nbenefit to them. 51. So the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds overtook\nthem. And the wrongdoers among these ˹pagans˺ will be overtaken by the\nevil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds. And they will have no escape. 52. Do\nthey not know that Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever\nHe wills? Surely in this are signs for people who believe.\nAllah Forgives All Sins\n53. Say, ˹O Prophet, that Allah says,˺ “O My servants who have exceeded\nthe limits against their souls! Do not lose hope in Allah’s mercy, for Allah\ncertainly forgives all sins.[963] He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful. 54. Turn to your Lord ˹in repentance˺, and ˹fully˺ submit to Him\nbefore the punishment reaches you, ˹for˺ then you will not be helped. 55.\nFollow ˹the Quran,˺ the best of what has been revealed to you from your\nLord, before the punishment takes you by surprise while you are unaware,\n56. so that no ˹sinful˺ soul will say ˹on Judgment Day˺, ‘Woe to me for\nneglecting ˹my duties towards˺ Allah, while ridiculing ˹the truth˺.’ 57. Or ˹a\nsoul will˺ say, ‘If only Allah had guided me, I would have certainly been\none of the righteous.’ 58. Or say, upon seeing the torment, ‘If only I had a\nsecond chance, I would have been one of the good-doers.’ 59. Not at all!\nMy revelations had already come to you, but you rejected them, acted\narrogantly, and were one of the disbelievers.”\nJudgment Day\n60. On the Day of Judgment you will see those who lied about Allah with\ntheir faces gloomy. Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the arrogant? 61. And\nAllah will deliver those who were mindful ˹of Him˺ to their place of\n˹ultimate˺ triumph. No evil will touch them, nor will they grieve. 62. Allah\nis the Creator of all things, and He is the Maintainer of everything. 63. To\nHim belong the keys ˹of the treasuries˺ of the heavens and the earth. As for\nthose who rejected the signs of Allah, it is they who will be the ˹true˺ losers.\nOne God Alone\n\n-- 406 of 694 --\n\n64. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Are you urging me to worship ˹anyone˺ other than\nAllah, O ignorant ones?” 65. It has already been revealed to you—and to\nthose ˹prophets˺ before you—that if you associate others ˹with Allah˺, your\ndeeds will certainly be void and you will truly be one of the losers. 66.\nRather, worship Allah ˹alone˺ and be one of the grateful.\nBeginning of the End\n67. They have not shown Allah His proper reverence—when on the Day of\nJudgment the ˹whole˺ earth will be in His Grip, and the heavens will be\nrolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they\nassociate ˹with Him˺! 68. The Trumpet will be blown and all those in the\nheavens and all those on the earth will fall dead, except those Allah wills ˹to\nspare˺. Then it will be blown again and they will rise up at once, looking on\n˹in anticipation˺.\nDivine Justice\n69. The earth[964] will shine with the light of its Lord, the record ˹of deeds˺\nwill be laid ˹open˺, the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward\n—and judgment will be passed on all with fairness. None will be wronged.\n70. Every soul will be paid in full for its deeds, for Allah knows best what\nthey have done.\nReward of the Wicked\n71. Those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in ˹successive˺ groups.\nWhen they arrive there, its gates will be opened and its keepers will ask\nthem: “Did messengers not come to you from among yourselves, reciting to\nyou the revelations of your Lord and warning you of the coming of this Day\nof yours?” The disbelievers will cry, “Yes ˹indeed˺! But the decree of\ntorment has come to pass against the disbelievers.” 72. It will be said to\nthem, “Enter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever.” What an evil home for\nthe arrogant!\nReward of the Righteous\n73. And those who were mindful of their Lord will be led to Paradise in\n˹successive˺ groups. When they arrive at its ˹already˺ open gates, its keepers\nwill say, “Peace be upon you! You have done well, so come in, to stay\nforever.” 74. The righteous will say, “Praise be to Allah Who has fulfilled\nHis promise to us, and made us inherit the ˹everlasting˺ land[965] to settle in\n\n-- 407 of 694 --\n\nParadise wherever we please.” How excellent is the reward of those who\nwork ˹righteousness˺!\nPraising Allah’s Grace and Justice\n75. You will see the angels all around the Throne, glorifying the praises of\ntheir Lord, for judgment will have been passed on all with fairness. And it\nwill be said,[966] “Praise be to Allah—Lord of all worlds!”\n***\n\n-- 408 of 694 --\n\n40. The Forgiver\n(Ghâfir)\nIn essence, this Meccan sûrah emphasizes the main concepts highlighted\nboth in the previous and following sûrahs—namely Allah being infinite in\nmercy and severe in punishment, and humanity being either grateful or\nungrateful to their Lord along with the reward that ensues. All this is\nembodied in the story of Moses (verses 23-54)—with Pharaoh as the\nungrateful disbeliever and an unidentified man from Pharaoh’s people as\nthe grateful believer. The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is repeatedly advised to be\npatient, keeping in mind that Allah never lets His prophets down (verses 51\nand 77).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Quran Is from the Almighty\n1.\nḤâ-Mĩm. 2. The revelation of this Book is from Allah—the Almighty,\nAll-Knowing, 3. the Forgiver of sin and Accepter of repentance, the Severe\nin punishment, and Infinite in bounty. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺\nexcept Him. To Him ˹alone˺ is the final return.\nWarning to the Disbelievers\n4. None disputes the signs of Allah except the disbelievers, so do not be\ndeceived by their prosperity throughout the land. 5. Before them, the people\nof Noah denied ˹the truth˺, as did ˹other˺ enemy forces afterwards. Every\ncommunity plotted against its prophet to seize him, and argued in\nfalsehood, ˹hoping˺ to discredit the truth with it. So I seized them. And how\n˹horrible˺ was My punishment! 6. And so your Lord’s decree has been\nproven true against the disbelievers—that they will be the inmates of the\nFire.\nAngels Pray for the Believers\n7. Those ˹angels˺ who carry the Throne and those around it glorify the\npraises of their Lord, have faith in Him, and seek forgiveness for the\nbelievers, ˹praying:˺ “Our Lord! You encompass everything in ˹Your˺ mercy\nand knowledge. So forgive those who repent and follow Your Way, and\n\n-- 409 of 694 --\n\nprotect them from the torment of the Hellfire. 8. Our Lord! Admit them into\nthe Gardens of Eternity which You have promised them, along with the\nrighteous among their parents, spouses, and descendants. You ˹alone˺ are\ntruly the Almighty, All-Wise. 9. And protect them from ˹the consequences\nof their˺ evil deeds. For whoever You protect from the evil of their deeds on\nthat Day will have been shown Your mercy. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate\ntriumph.”\nThe Inmates of Hell\n10. Indeed, it will be announced to the disbelievers, “Allah’s contempt for\nyou—as you disbelieved when invited to belief—was far worse than your\ncontempt for one another ˹Today˺.” 11. They will plead, “Our Lord! You\nmade us lifeless twice, and gave us life twice.[967] Now we confess our sins.\nSo is there any way out?” 12. ˹They will be told,˺ “˹No!˺ This is because\nwhen Allah alone was invoked, you ˹staunchly˺ disbelieved. But when\nothers were associated with Him ˹in worship˺, you ˹readily˺ believed. So\n˹Today˺ judgment belongs to Allah ˹alone˺—the Most High, All-Great.”\nAllah’s Might in Both Worlds\n13. He is the One Who shows you His signs and sends down ˹rain as˺ a\nprovision for you from the sky. ˹But˺ none will be mindful except those who\nturn ˹to Him˺. 14. So call upon Allah with sincere devotion, even to the\ndismay of the disbelievers. 15. ˹He is˺ Highly Exalted in rank, Lord of the\nThrone. He sends down the revelation by His command to whoever He\nwills of His servants to warn ˹all˺ of the Day of Meeting— 16. the Day all\nwill appear ˹before Allah˺. Nothing about them will be hidden from Him.\n˹He will ask,˺ “Who does all authority belong to this Day? To Allah—the\nOne, the Supreme![968] 17. Today every soul will be rewarded for what it\nhas done. No injustice Today! Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.”\nHorrors of Judgment Day\n18. Warn them ˹O Prophet˺ of the approaching Day when the hearts will\njump into the throats, suppressing distress. The wrongdoers will have\nneither a close friend nor intercessor to be heard. 19. Allah ˹even˺ knows the\nsly glances of the eyes and whatever the hearts conceal. 20. And Allah\njudges with the truth, while those ˹idols˺ they invoke besides Him cannot\njudge at all. Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.\n\n-- 410 of 694 --\n\nFate of the Deniers\n21. Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of\nthose ˹destroyed˺ before them? They were far superior in might and ˹richer\nin˺ monuments throughout the land. But Allah seized them for their sins,\nand they had no protector from Allah. 22. That was because their\nmessengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they persisted in\ndisbelief. So Allah seized them. Surely He is All-Powerful, severe in\npunishment.\nMoses Denied in Egypt\n23. Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs and compelling proof 24. to\nPharaoh, Hamân, and Korah. But they responded: “Magician! Total liar!”\n25. Then, when he came to them with the truth from Us, they said, “Kill the\nsons of those who believe with him and keep their women.” But the plotting\nof the disbelievers was only in vain. 26. And Pharaoh said, “Let me kill\nMoses, and let him call upon his Lord! I truly fear that he may change your\ntraditions or cause mischief in the land.” 27. Moses replied, “I seek refuge\nin my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant person who does not believe\nin the Day of Reckoning.”\nThe Believer’s Advice: 1) Do Not Persecute for Belief\n28. A believing man from Pharaoh’s people, who was hiding his faith,\nargued, “Will you kill a man[969] ˹only˺ for saying: ‘My Lord is Allah,’\nwhile he has in fact come to you with clear proofs from your Lord? If he is\na liar, it will be to his own loss. But if he is truthful, then you will be\nafflicted with some of what he is threatening you with. Surely Allah does\nnot guide whoever is a transgressor, a total liar. 29. O my people! Authority\nbelongs to you today, reigning supreme in the land. But who would help us\nagainst the torment of Allah, if it were to befall us?” Pharaoh assured ˹his\npeople˺, “I am telling you only what I believe, and I am leading you only to\nthe way of guidance.”\nAdvice 2) Learn from History\n30. And the man who believed cautioned, “O my people! I truly fear for\nyou the doom of ˹earlier˺ enemy forces— 31. like the fate of the people of\nNoah, ’Ȃd, Thamûd, and those after them. For Allah would never will to\nwrong ˹His˺ servants. 32. O my people! I truly fear for you the Day all will\nbe crying out ˹to each other˺— 33. the Day you will ˹try in vain to˺ turn\n\n-- 411 of 694 --\n\nyour backs and run away, with no one to protect you from Allah. And\nwhoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide. 34. Joseph already\ncame to you[970] earlier with clear proofs, yet you never ceased to doubt\nwhat he came to you with. When he died you said, ‘Allah will never send a\nmessenger after him.’ This is how Allah leaves every transgressor and\ndoubter to stray— 35. those who dispute Allah’s signs with no proof given\nto them. How despicable is that for Allah and the believers! This is how\nAllah seals the heart of every arrogant tyrant.”\nPharaoh’s Response\n36. Pharaoh ordered, “O Hamân! Build me a high tower so I may reach the\npathways 37. leading up to the heavens and look for the God of Moses,\nalthough I am sure he is a liar.”[971] And so Pharaoh’s evil deeds were made\nso appealing to him that he was hindered from the ˹Right˺ Way. But the\nplotting of Pharaoh was only in vain.\nAdvice 3) Mend Your Ways\n38. And the man who believed urged, “O my people! Follow me, ˹and˺ I\nwill lead you to the Way of Guidance. 39. O my people! This worldly life is\nonly ˹a fleeting˺ enjoyment, whereas the Hereafter is truly the home of\nsettlement. 40. Whoever does an evil deed will only be paid back with its\nequivalent. And whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a\nbeliever, they will enter Paradise, where they will be provided for without\nlimit. 41. O my people! How is it that I invite you to salvation, while you\ninvite me to the Fire! 42. You invite me to disbelieve in Allah and associate\nwith Him what I have no knowledge of, while I invite you to the Almighty,\nMost Forgiving. 43. There is no doubt that whatever ˹idols˺ you invite me to\n˹worship˺ are not worthy to be invoked either in this world or the Hereafter.\n[972] ˹Undoubtedly,˺ our return is to Allah, and the transgressors will be the\ninmates of the Fire. 44. You will remember what I say to you, and I entrust\nmy affairs to Allah. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of all ˹His˺ servants.”\nAllah’s Response\n45. So Allah protected him from the evil of their schemes. And Pharaoh’s\npeople were overwhelmed by an evil punishment: 46. they are exposed to\nthe Fire ˹in their graves˺ morning and evening. And on the Day the Hour\n\n-- 412 of 694 --\n\nwill be established ˹it will be said˺, “Admit Pharaoh’s people into the\nharshest punishment ˹of Hell˺.”\nDisputes Among Hell’s Inmates\n47. ˹Consider the Day˺ when they will dispute in the Fire, and the lowly\n˹followers˺ will appeal to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “We were your ˹dedicated˺\nfollowers, will you then shield us from a portion of the Fire?” 48. The\narrogant will say, “We are all in it! ˹For˺ Allah has already passed judgment\nover ˹His˺ servants.”\nAppeals from Hell\n49. And those in the Fire will cry out to the keepers of Hell,[973] “Pray to\nyour Lord to lighten the torment for us ˹even˺ for one day!” 50. The keepers\nwill reply, “Did your messengers not ˹constantly˺ come to you with clear\nproofs?” They will say, “Yes ˹they did˺.” The keepers will say, “Then pray!\nThough the prayer of the disbelievers is only in vain.”\nAllah’s Help for the Believers\n51. We certainly help Our messengers and the believers, ˹both˺ in this\nworldly life and on the Day the witnesses will stand forth ˹for testimony˺—\n52. the Day the wrongdoers’ excuses will be of no benefit to them. They\nwill be condemned, and will have the worst outcome.[974]\nReassuring the Prophet\n53. And indeed, We gave Moses ˹true˺ guidance, and made the Children of\nIsrael inherit the Scripture— 54. a guide and a reminder to people of reason.\n55. So be patient ˹O Prophet˺, ˹for˺ Allah’s promise is certainly true. Seek\nforgiveness for your shortcomings.[975] And glorify the praises of your Lord\nmorning and evening. 56. Surely those who dispute Allah’s signs—with no\nproof given to them—have nothing in their hearts but greed for dominance,\nwhich they will never attain. So seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He alone is\nthe All-Hearing, All-Seeing.\nGreater Creation\n57. The creation of the heavens and the earth is certainly greater than the re-\ncreation of humankind, but most people do not know.\nParable of Belief and Disbelief\n58. Those blind ˹to the truth˺ and those who can see are not equal, nor are\nthose who believe and do good ˹equal˺ to those who do evil. Yet you are\n\n-- 413 of 694 --\n\nhardly mindful. 59. The Hour is certainly coming, there is no doubt about it.\nBut most people do not believe.\nAllah Answers Prayers\n60. Your Lord has proclaimed, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you. Surely\nthose who are too proud to worship Me will enter Hell, fully humbled.”\nAllah Is Merciful to His Creation\n61. It is Allah Who has made the night for you to rest in and the day bright.\nSurely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most people are ungrateful.\n62. That is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things. There is no god\n˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be deluded ˹from the\ntruth˺? 63. This is how those who used to reject Allah’s signs were ˹also˺\ndeluded.\nAllah Provides for All\n64. It is Allah Who made the earth a place of settlement for you and the sky\na canopy. He shaped you ˹in the womb˺, perfecting your form. And He has\nprovided you with what is good and lawful. That is Allah—your Lord. So\nBlessed is Allah, Lord of all worlds. 65. He is the Ever-Living. There is no\ngod ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. So call upon Him with sincere\ndevotion, ˹saying,˺ “All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds.”\nAllah Has Power over Life and Death\n66. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have been forbidden to worship those ˹idols˺ you\nworship besides Allah, since clear proofs have come to me from my Lord.\nAnd I have been commanded to ˹fully˺ submit to the Lord of all worlds.”\n67. He is the One Who created you[976] from dust, then from a sperm-drop,\n[977] then ˹developed you into˺ a clinging clot ˹of blood˺,[978] then He brings\nyou forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime, and become old—\nthough some of you ˹may˺ die sooner—reaching an appointed time, so\nperhaps you may understand ˹Allah’s power˺. 68. He is the One Who gives\nlife and causes death. When He decrees a matter, He simply tells it, “Be!”\nAnd it is!\nPunishment of the Deniers\n69. Have you not seen how those who dispute Allah’s signs are turned\naway? 70. ˹They are˺ the ones who reject this Book and all ˹scriptures˺ We\nsent Our messengers with. So they will know ˹the consequences˺ 71. when\n\n-- 414 of 694 --\n\nshackles will be around their necks and chains ˹on their legs˺. They will be\ndragged 72. through boiling water, then burned in the Fire ˹as fuel˺. 73.\nThen they will be asked, “Where are those ˹idols˺ you used to associate 74.\nwith Allah?” They will cry, “They have ˹all˺ failed us. In fact, we did not\ninvoke anything ˹real˺ before.” This is how Allah leaves the disbelievers to\nstray. 75. ˹They will be told,˺ “This ˹punishment˺ is for being prideful on\nearth unjustly and for acting arrogantly. 76. Enter the gates of Hell, to stay\nthere forever. What an evil home for the arrogant!”\nAdvice to the Prophet\n77. So be patient ˹O Prophet˺. Surely Allah’s promise is true. Whether We\nshow you some of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die ˹before\nthat˺, to Us they will ˹all˺ be returned. 78. We already sent messengers\nbefore you. We have told you the stories of some of them, while others We\nhave not. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign without Allah’s\npermission. But when Allah’s decree comes, judgment will be passed with\nfairness, and the people of falsehood will then be in ˹total˺ loss.\nSome of Allah’s Favours\n79. It is Allah Who made cattle for you so that you may ride some and eat\nothers. 80. Also, you find in them ˹other˺ benefits.[979] And by means of\nthem you may reach destinations you desire. And you are carried upon\n˹some of˺ them and upon ships. 81. And He shows you His signs. Now\nwhich of Allah’s signs will you deny?\nMore Warning to the Deniers\n82. Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of\nthose who were ˹destroyed˺ before them? They were far superior in might\nand ˹richer in˺ monuments throughout the land, but their ˹worldly˺ gains\nwere of no benefit to them. 83. When their messengers came to them with\nclear proofs, they were prideful in whatever ˹worldly˺ knowledge they had,\n[980] and were ˹ultimately˺ overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. 84.\nWhen they saw Our punishment, they cried, “˹Now˺ we believe in Allah\nalone and reject what we had been associating with Him!” 85. But their\nfaith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our torment. This has\n˹always˺ been Allah’s way ˹of dealing˺ with His ˹wicked˺ servants. Then\nand there the disbelievers were in ˹total˺ loss.\n\n-- 415 of 694 --\n\n***\n\n-- 416 of 694 --\n\n41. ˹Verses˺ Perfectly Explained\n(Fu\nṣṣilat)\nThis Meccan sûrah, which takes its name from the description of the Quran\nin verse 3, rebukes the pagans for turning away from the truth; abusing the\nQuran; and for denying Allah, the sole Creator of the heavens and the\nearth. The deniers are warned that their own bodily organs will testify\nagainst them on Judgment Day, landing them in Hell forever. Reference to\nthe destruction of the arrogant, ungrateful peoples of ’\nȂd and Thamûd is\nmade because the pagan Arabs used to pass by their ruins on their journeys\nto Syria and Yemen, respectively. A profound description of the righteous is\ngiven in verses 30-36. The truth of the Quran is emphasized at the end of\nthis sûrah and the beginning of the next.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Deniers of the Truth\n1.\nḤâ-Mĩm. 2. ˹This is˺ a revelation from the Most Compassionate, Most\nMerciful. 3. ˹It is˺ a Book whose verses are perfectly explained—a Quran in\nArabic for people who know, 4. delivering good news and warning. Yet\nmost of them turn away, so they do not hear. 5. They say, “Our hearts are\nveiled against what you are calling us to, there is deafness in our ears, and\nthere is a barrier between us and you. So do ˹whatever you want˺ and so\nshall we!”\nA Message to the Deniers\n6. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a man like you, ˹but˺ it has been revealed to\nme that your God is only One God. So take the Straight Way towards Him,\nand seek His forgiveness. And woe to the polytheists— 7. those who do not\npay alms-tax and are in denial of the Hereafter. 8. ˹But˺ those who believe\nand do good will certainly have a never-ending reward.\nA Question to the Deniers\n9. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “How can you disbelieve in the One Who created\nthe earth in two Days? And how can you set up equals with Him? That is\nthe Lord of all worlds. 10. He placed on the earth firm mountains, standing\n\n-- 417 of 694 --\n\nhigh, showered His blessings upon it, and ordained ˹all˺ its means of\nsustenance—totaling four Days exactly[981]—for all who ask. 11. Then He\nturned towards the heaven when it was ˹still like˺ smoke, saying to it and to\nthe earth, ‘Submit, willingly or unwillingly.’ They both responded, ‘We\nsubmit willingly.’ 12. So He formed the heaven into seven heavens in two\nDays, assigning to each its mandate. And We adorned the lowest heaven\nwith ˹stars like˺ lamps ˹for beauty˺ and for protection. That is the design of\nthe Almighty, All-Knowing.”[982]\nThe Fate of ’\nȂd and Thamûd\n13. If they turn away, then say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I warn you of a ˹mighty˺ blast,\nlike the one that befell ’Ȃd and Thamûd.” 14. The messengers had come to\nthem from all angles, ˹proclaiming,˺ “Worship none but Allah.” They\nresponded, “Had our Lord willed, He could have easily sent down angels\n˹instead˺. So we totally reject what you have been sent with.” 15. As for\n’Ȃd, they acted arrogantly throughout the land with no right, boasting,\n“Who is superior to us in might?” Did they not see that Allah ˹Himself˺,\nWho created them, was far superior to them in might? Still they persisted in\ndenying Our signs. 16. So We sent against them a furious wind,[983] for\n˹several˺ miserable days, to make them taste a humiliating punishment in\nthis worldly life. But far more humiliating will be the punishment of the\nHereafter. And they will not be helped. 17. As for Thamûd, We showed\nthem guidance, but they preferred blindness over guidance. So the blast of a\ndisgracing punishment overtook them for what they used to commit. 18.\nAnd We delivered those who were faithful and were mindful ˹of Allah˺.\nTestimony of Organs\n19. ˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ the enemies of Allah will be gathered for the\nFire, all driven in ranks. 20. When they reach it, their ears, eyes, and skin\nwill testify against what they used to do.[984] 21. They will ask their skin\n˹furiously˺, “Why have you testified against us?” It will say, “We have been\nmade to speak by Allah, Who causes all things to speak. He ˹is the One\nWho˺ created you the first time, and to Him you were bound to return. 22.\nYou did not ˹bother to˺ hide yourselves from your ears, eyes, and skin to\nprevent them from testifying against you. Rather, you assumed that Allah\ndid not know much of what you used to do. 23. It was that ˹false˺\nassumption you entertained about your Lord that has brought about your\n\n-- 418 of 694 --\n\ndoom, so you have become losers.” 24. Even if they endure patiently, the\nFire will ˹always˺ be their home. And if they ˹beg to˺ appease ˹their Lord˺,\nthey will never be allowed to.\nWhat Caused That Fate\n25. We placed at their disposal ˹evil˺ associates who made their past and\nfuture ˹misdeeds˺ appealing to them.[985] ˹So˺ the fate of earlier\ncommunities of jinn and humans has been justified against them ˹as well˺,\n˹for˺ they were truly losers. 26. The disbelievers advised ˹one another˺, “Do\nnot listen to this Quran but drown it out so that you may prevail.” 27. So We\nwill certainly make the disbelievers taste a severe punishment, and We will\nsurely repay them according to the worst of their deeds. 28. That is the\nreward of Allah’s enemies: the Fire, which will be their eternal home—a\n˹fitting˺ reward for their denial of Our revelations. 29. The disbelievers will\n˹then˺ cry, “Our Lord! Show us those jinn and humans who led us astray:\nwe will put them under our feet so that they will be among the lowest ˹in\nHell˺.”\nReward of the Devout\n30. Surely those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remain steadfast,\nthe angels descend upon them,[986] ˹saying,˺ “Do not fear, nor grieve.\nRather, rejoice in the good news of Paradise, which you have been\npromised. 31. We are your supporters in this worldly life and in the\nHereafter. There you will have whatever your souls desire, and there you\nwill have whatever you ask for: 32. an accommodation from the All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful ˹Lord˺.”\nQualities of True Believers\n33. And whose words are better than someone who calls ˹others˺ to Allah,\ndoes good, and says, “I am truly one of those who submit.”?[987] 34. Good\nand evil cannot be equal. Respond ˹to evil˺ with what is best, then the one\nyou are in a feud with will be like a close friend. 35. But this cannot be\nattained except by those who are patient and who are truly fortunate. 36.\nAnd if you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Indeed, He\n˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\nWorship the Creator, Marvel at Creation\n\n-- 419 of 694 --\n\n37. Among His signs are the day and the night, the sun and the moon. Do\nnot prostrate to the sun or the moon, but prostrate to Allah, Who created\nthem ˹all˺, if you ˹truly˺ worship Him ˹alone˺. 38. But if the pagans are too\nproud, then ˹let them know that˺ those ˹angels˺ nearest to your Lord glorify\nHim day and night, and never grow weary. 39. And among His signs is that\nyou see the earth devoid of life, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it\nbegins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell. Indeed, the One Who revives it can easily\nrevive the dead. He is certainly Most Capable of everything.\nWarning to the Quran Deniers\n40. Indeed, those who abuse Our revelations[988] are not hidden from Us.\nWho is better: the one who will be cast into the Fire or the one who will be\nsecure on Judgment Day? Do whatever you want. He is certainly All-\nSeeing of what you do. 41. Indeed, those who deny the Reminder[989] after\nit has come to them ˹are doomed˺, for it is truly a mighty Book. 42. It\ncannot be proven false from any angle. ˹It is˺ a revelation from the ˹One\nWho is˺ All-Wise, Praiseworthy. 43. ˹O Prophet!˺ Nothing is said to you ˹by\nthe deniers˺ except what was already said to the messengers before you.\nSurely your Lord is ˹the Lord˺ of forgiveness and painful punishment.\nResponse to Demanding Non-Arabic Quran\n44. Had We revealed it as a non-Arabic Quran, they would have certainly\nargued, “If only its verses were made clear ˹in our language˺. What! A non-\nArabic revelation for an Arab audience!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It is a guide\nand a healing to the believers. As for those who disbelieve, there is deafness\nin their ears and blindness to it ˹in their hearts˺. It is as if they are being\ncalled from a faraway place.”[990]\nMoses Was Denied Too\n45. Indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture, but differences arose\nregarding it. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord,[991] their\ndifferences would have been settled ˹at once˺. They are truly in alarming\ndoubt about it.\nThe Good and the Wicked\n46. Whoever does good, it is to their own benefit. And whoever does evil, it\nis to their own loss. Your Lord is never unjust to ˹His˺ creation.\nAllah’s Infinite Knowledge\n\n-- 420 of 694 --\n\n47. With Him ˹alone˺ is the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit comes out of\nits husk, nor does a female conceive or deliver without His knowledge. And\n˹consider˺ the Day He will call to those ˹pagans˺, “Where are My ˹so-called˺\nassociate-gods?” They will cry, “We declare before you that none of us\ntestifies to that ˹any longer˺.” 48. Whatever ˹idols˺ they used to invoke\nbesides Allah will fail them. And they will realize that they will have no\nescape.\nIngratitude of the Deniers\n49. One never tires of praying for good. And if touched with evil, they\nbecome desperate and hopeless. 50. And if We let them taste a mercy from\nUs after being touched with adversity, they will certainly say, “This is what\nI deserve. I do not think the Hour will ˹ever˺ come. And if in fact I am\nreturned to my Lord, the finest reward with Him will definitely be mine.”\nBut We will surely inform the disbelievers of what they used to do. And We\nwill certainly make them taste a harsh torment. 51. When We show favour\nto someone, they turn away, acting arrogantly. And when touched with evil,\nthey make endless prayers ˹for good˺.\nDenying Allah’s Revelation\n52. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Imagine if this ˹Quran˺ is ˹truly˺ from Allah\nand you deny it: who can be more astray than those who have gone too far\nin opposition ˹to the truth˺?”\nCreation Testifies to the Truth\n53. We will show them Our signs in the universe and within themselves\nuntil it becomes clear to them that this ˹Quran˺ is the truth. Is it not enough\nthat your Lord is a Witness over all things? 54. They are truly in doubt of\nthe meeting with their Lord! ˹But˺ He is indeed Fully Aware of everything.\n***\n\n-- 421 of 694 --\n\n42. Consultation\n(Ash-Shûra)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from verse 38 which talks about\nconducting affairs by mutual consultation as one of the qualities of the true\nbelievers. The sûrah emphasizes that Allah has decreed for Muslims the\nsame religion ordained for all the previous prophets. The believers are\ncommanded to resort to Allah’s judgment if disagreement arises. Allah’s\noneness, power, and wisdom are emphasized as the pagans’ faith in\npowerless idols is condemned. Both the end of this sûrah and the beginning\nof the next stress the fact that the Quran has been revealed by Allah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah Almighty\n1.\nḤâ-Mĩm. 2. ’Aĩn-Sĩn-Qãf. 3. And so you ˹O Prophet˺ are sent revelation,\njust like those before you, by Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise. 4. To Him\nbelongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And He is\nthe Most High, the Greatest. 5. The heavens nearly burst, one above the\nother, ˹in awe of Him˺. And the angels glorify the praises of their Lord, and\nseek forgiveness for those on earth. Surely Allah alone is the All-Forgiving,\nMost Merciful.\nAllah Is the Protector\n6. As for those who take other protectors besides Him, Allah is Watchful\nover them. And you ˹O Prophet˺ are not a keeper over them. 7. And so We\nhave revealed to you a Quran in Arabic, so you may warn the Mother of\nCities[992] and everyone around it, and warn of the Day of Gathering—\nabout which there is no doubt—˹when˺ a group will be in Paradise and\nanother in the Blaze. 8. Had Allah willed, He could have easily made all\n˹humanity˺ into a single community ˹of believers˺. But He admits into His\nmercy whoever He wills. And the wrongdoers will have no protector or\nhelper. 9. How can they take protectors besides Him? Allah alone is the\nProtector. He ˹alone˺ gives life to the dead. And He ˹alone˺ is Most Capable\nof everything.\n\n-- 422 of 694 --\n\nAdvice to the Believers\n10. ˹Say to the believers, O Prophet,˺ “Whatever you may differ about, its\njudgment rests with Allah. That is Allah—my Lord. In Him I put my trust,\nand to Him I ˹always˺ turn.”\nAllah Is the Creator and Provider\n11. ˹He is˺ the Originator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you\nspouses from among yourselves, and ˹made˺ mates for cattle ˹as well˺—\nmultiplying you ˹both˺. There is nothing like Him, for He ˹alone˺ is the All-\nHearing, All-Seeing. 12. To Him belong the keys ˹of the treasuries˺ of the\nheavens and the earth. He gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever\nHe wills. Indeed, He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.\nOne Message, Different Laws[993]\n13. He has ordained for you ˹believers˺ the Way which He decreed for\nNoah, and what We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and what We decreed\nfor Abraham, Moses, and Jesus,[994] ˹commanding:˺ “Uphold the faith, and\nmake no divisions in it.” What you call the polytheists to is unbearable for\nthem. Allah chooses for Himself whoever He wills, and guides to Himself\nwhoever turns ˹to Him˺. 14. They did not split ˹into sects˺ out of mutual\nenvy until knowledge came to them.[995] Had it not been for a prior decree\nfrom your Lord for an appointed term,[996] the matter would have certainly\nbeen settled between them ˹at once˺. And surely those who were made to\ninherit the Scripture[997] after them are truly in alarming doubt about this\n˹Quran˺.\nCall to the People of the Book\n15. Because of that, you ˹O Prophet˺ will invite ˹all˺. Be steadfast as you are\ncommanded, and do not follow their desires. And say, “I believe in every\nScripture Allah has revealed. And I am commanded to judge fairly among\nyou. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We will be accountable for our deeds\nand you for yours. There is no ˹need for˺ contention between us. Allah will\ngather us together ˹for judgment˺. And to Him is the final return.” 16. As\nfor those who dispute about Allah after He is ˹already˺ acknowledged ˹by\nmany˺, their argument is futile in the sight of their Lord. Upon them is\nwrath, and they will suffer a severe punishment.\nA Reminder of the Hour\n\n-- 423 of 694 --\n\n17. It is Allah Who has revealed the Book with the truth and the balance ˹of\njustice˺. You never know, perhaps the Hour is near. 18. Those who\ndisbelieve in it ˹ask to˺ hasten it ˹mockingly˺. But the believers are fearful of\nit, knowing that it is the truth. Surely those who dispute about the Hour\nhave gone far astray.\nAllah’s Graciousness\n19. Allah is Ever Kind to His servants. He provides ˹abundantly˺ to\nwhoever He wills. And He is the All-Powerful, Almighty.\nWorldly Gains and Heavenly Rewards\n20. Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We will increase their\nharvest. And whoever desires ˹only˺ the harvest of this world, We will give\nthem some of it, but they will have no share in the Hereafter.\nReward of the Believers and Polytheists\n21. Or do they have associate-gods who have ordained for them some\n˹polytheistic˺ beliefs, which Allah has not authorized? Had it not been for\n˹prior˺ decree on Judgment, the matter would have certainly been settled\nbetween them ˹at once˺. And surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful\npunishment. 22. You will see the wrongdoers fearful ˹of the punishment˺ for\nwhat they committed but it will be inevitable for them, whereas those who\nbelieve and do good will be in the lush Gardens of Paradise. They will have\nwhatever they desire from their Lord. That is ˹truly˺ the greatest bounty. 23.\nThat ˹reward˺ is the good news which Allah gives to His servants who\nbelieve and do good. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not ask you ˹Meccans˺ for a\nreward for this ˹message˺—only honour for ˹our˺ kinship.”[998] Whoever\nearns a good deed, We will increase it in goodness for them. Surely Allah is\nAll-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.\nThe Quran Fabricated?\n24. Or do they say, “He has fabricated a lie about Allah!”? ˹If you had,˺\nAllah would have sealed your heart, if He willed. And Allah wipes out\nfalsehood and establishes the truth by His Words. He certainly knows best\nwhat is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.\nAllah’s Grace and Might\n25. He is the One Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons\n˹their˺ sins. And He knows whatever you do. 26. He responds to those who\n\n-- 424 of 694 --\n\nbelieve and do good, and increases their reward out of His grace. As for the\ndisbelievers, they will suffer a severe punishment.\nAllah’s Mercy: Provisions and Rain\n27. Had Allah given abundant provisions to ˹all˺ His servants, they would\nhave certainly transgressed throughout the land. But He sends down\nwhatever He wills in perfect measure. He is truly All-Aware, All-Seeing of\nHis servants. 28. He is the One Who sends down rain after people have\ngiven up hope, spreading out His mercy. He is the Guardian, the\nPraiseworthy.\nAllah’s Mercy: The Universe\n29. And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and\nall living beings He dispersed throughout both. And He is Most Capable of\nbringing all together whenever He wills. 30. Whatever affliction befalls you\nis because of what your own hands have committed. And He pardons much.\n31. You can never escape ˹Him˺ on earth, nor do you have any protector or\nhelper besides Allah.\nAllah’s Mercy: Sailing Ships\n32. And among His signs are the ships like mountains ˹sailing˺ in the sea.\n33. If He wills, He can calm the wind, leaving the ships motionless on the\nwater. Surely in this are signs for whoever is steadfast, grateful. 34. Or He\ncan wreck the ships for what the people have committed—though He\nforgives much— 35. so those who dispute about Our signs may know that\nthey have no refuge.\nQualities of the Devout\n36. Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is ˹no more than a fleeting˺\nenjoyment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far better and more\nlasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord; 37. who avoid\nmajor sins and shameful deeds, and forgive when angered; 38. who respond\nto their Lord, establish prayer, conduct their affairs by mutual consultation,\nand donate from what We have provided for them; 39. and who enforce\njustice when wronged. 40. The reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. But\nwhoever pardons and seeks reconciliation, then their reward is with Allah.\nHe certainly does not like the wrongdoers. 41. There is no blame on those\nwho enforce justice after being wronged. 42. Blame is only on those who\n\n-- 425 of 694 --\n\nwrong people and transgress in the land unjustly. It is they who will suffer a\npainful punishment. 43. And whoever endures patiently and forgives—\nsurely this is a resolve to aspire to.\nThe Wicked on Judgment Day\n44. And whoever Allah leaves to stray will have no guide after Him. You\nwill see the wrongdoers, when they face the torment, pleading, “Is there any\nway back ˹to the world˺?” 45. And you will see them exposed to the Fire,\nfully humbled out of disgrace, stealing glances ˹at it˺. And the believers will\nsay, “The ˹true˺ losers are those who have lost themselves and their families\non Judgment Day.” The wrongdoers will certainly be in everlasting torment.\n46. They will have no protectors to help them against Allah. And whoever\nAllah leaves to stray, for them there is no way.\nWarning to Ungrateful Disbelievers\n47. Respond to your Lord before the coming of a Day from Allah that\ncannot be averted. There will be no refuge for you then, nor ˹grounds for˺\ndenial ˹of sins˺.[999] 48. But if they turn away, We have not sent you ˹O\nProphet˺ as a keeper over them. Your duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺.\nAnd indeed, when We let someone taste a mercy from Us, they become\nprideful ˹because˺ of it. But when afflicted with evil because of what their\nhands have done, then one becomes totally ungrateful.[1000]\nAllah’s Gift of Children\n49. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He\ncreates whatever He wills. He blesses whoever He wills with daughters, and\nblesses whoever He wills with sons, 50. or grants both, sons and daughters,\n˹to whoever He wills˺, and leaves whoever He wills infertile. He is indeed\nAll-Knowing, Most Capable.\nForms of Divine Communication\n51. It is not ˹possible˺ for a human being to have Allah communicate with\nthem, except through inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by sending a\nmessenger-angel to reveal whatever He wills by His permission. He is\nsurely Most High, All-Wise.\nThe Light of the Quran\n52. And so We have sent to you ˹O Prophet˺ a revelation by Our command.\nYou did not know of ˹this˺ Book and faith ˹before˺. But We have made it a\n\n-- 426 of 694 --\n\nlight, by which We guide whoever We will of Our servants. And you are\ntruly leading ˹all˺ to the Straight Path— 53. the Path of Allah, to Whom\nbelongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Surely to\nAllah all matters will return ˹for judgment˺.\n***\n\n-- 427 of 694 --\n\n43. Ornaments\n(Az-Zukhruf)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the ornaments mentioned in verse\n35. The pagans are scorned for following their forefathers blindly, labelling\nthe angels as Allah’s daughters, claiming that Mu\nḥammad (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is not\nworthy to receive revelations because he is not rich, and for associating\nidols with Allah in worship, although they admit that He is the sole Creator\nof the heavens and the earth. Similar to the next sûrah, the pagans are\nwarned of a horrifying punishment in Hell and the believers are promised a\ngreat reward in Paradise.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nExcellence of the Quran\n1.\nḤâ-Mĩm. 2. By the clear Book! 3. Certainly, We have made it a Quran in\nArabic so perhaps you will understand. 4. And indeed, it is—in the Master\nRecord[1001] with Us—highly esteemed, rich in wisdom.\nWarning to the Deniers\n5. Should We then turn the ˹Quranic˺ Reminder away from you ˹simply˺\nbecause you have been a transgressing people? 6. ˹Imagine˺ how many\nprophets We sent to those ˹destroyed˺ before! 7. But no prophet ever came\nto them without being mocked. 8. So We destroyed those who were far\nmightier than these ˹Meccans˺. The examples of ˹their˺ predecessors have\n˹already˺ been related.[1002]\nAllah Is the Creator\n9. If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth, they\nwill certainly say, “The Almighty, All-Knowing did.” 10. ˹He is the One˺\nWho has laid out the earth for you, and set in it pathways for you so that\nyou may find your way. 11. And ˹He is the One˺ Who sends down rain from\nthe sky in perfect measure, with which We give life to a lifeless land. And\nso will you be brought forth ˹from the grave˺. 12. And ˹He is the One˺ Who\ncreated all ˹things in˺ pairs,[1003] and made for you ships and animals to ride\n13. so that you may sit firmly on their backs, and remember your Lord’s\n\n-- 428 of 694 --\n\nblessings once you are settled on them, saying, “Glory be to the One Who\nhas subjected these for us, for we could have never done so ˹on our own˺.\n14. And surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return.”\nAllah’s Daughters?\n15. Still the pagans have made some of His creation out to be a part of Him.\n[1004] Indeed, humankind is clearly ungrateful. 16. Has He taken ˹angels as\nHis˺ daughters from what He created, and favoured you ˹O pagans˺ with\nsons? 17. Whenever one of them is given the good news of what they\nattribute to the Most Compassionate,[1005] his face grows gloomy, as he\nsuppresses his rage. 18. ˹Do they attribute to Him˺ those who are brought up\nin fineries and are not commanding in disputes? 19. Still they have labelled\nthe angels, who are servants of the Most Compassionate, as female. Did\nthey witness their creation? Their statement will be recorded, and they will\nbe questioned!\nBlind Following\n20. And they argue, “Had the Most Compassionate willed, we would have\nnever worshipped them.” They have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this\n˹claim˺. They do nothing but lie. 21. Or have We given them a Book ˹for\nproof˺, before this ˹Quran˺, to which they are holding firm? 22. In fact, they\nsay, “We found our forefathers following a ˹particular˺ way, and we are\nfollowing in their footsteps.” 23. Similarly, whenever We sent a warner to a\nsociety before you ˹O Prophet˺, its ˹spoiled˺ elite would say, “We found our\nforefathers following a ˹particular˺ way, and we are walking in their\nfootsteps.” 24. Each ˹warner˺ asked, “Even if what I brought you is better\nguidance than what you found your forefathers practicing?” They replied,\n“We totally reject whatever you have been sent with.” 25. So We inflicted\npunishment upon them. See then what was the fate of the deniers!\nThe Case of Abraham’s People\n26. ˹Remember, O Prophet˺ when Abraham declared to his father and his\npeople, “I am totally free of whatever ˹gods˺ you worship, 27. except the\nOne Who originated me, and He will surely guide me.” 28. And he left this\nenduring declaration among his descendants, so they may ˹always˺ turn\nback ˹to Allah˺.[1006]\nThe Case of Meccan Pagans\n\n-- 429 of 694 --\n\n29. In fact, I had allowed enjoyment for these ˹Meccans˺ and their\nforefathers, until the truth came to them along with a messenger making\nthings clear. 30. ˹But˺ when the truth came to them, they said, “This is\nmagic, and we totally reject it.” 31. And they exclaimed, “If only this Quran\nwas revealed to a great man from ˹one of˺ the two cities!”[1007] 32. Is it they\nwho distribute your Lord’s mercy? We ˹alone˺ have distributed their ˹very˺\nlivelihood among them in this worldly life and raised some of them in rank\nabove others so that some may employ others in service. ˹But˺ your Lord’s\nmercy is far better than whatever ˹wealth˺ they amass.\nWorthlessness of Material Wealth\n33. Were it not that people might ˹be tempted to˺ become one community\n˹of disbelievers˺, We would have supplied the homes of ˹only˺ those who\ndisbelieve in the Most Compassionate with silver roofs and ˹silver˺\nstairways to ascend, 34. as well as ˹silver˺ gates and thrones to recline on,\n35. and ornaments ˹of gold˺. Yet all this is no more than a ˹fleeting˺\nenjoyment in this worldly life. ˹But˺ the Hereafter with your Lord is ˹only˺\nfor those mindful ˹of Him˺.\nDevilish Associates\n36. And whoever turns a blind eye to the Reminder of the Most\nCompassionate, We place at the disposal of each a devilish one as their\nclose associate, 37. who will certainly hinder them from the ˹Right˺ Way\nwhile they think they are ˹rightly˺ guided. 38. But when such a person\ncomes to Us, one will say ˹to their associate˺, “I wish you were as distant\nfrom me as the east is from the west! What an evil associate ˹you were˺!”\n39. ˹It will be said to both,˺ “Since you all did wrong, sharing in the\npunishment will be of no benefit to you this Day.”[1008]\nAdvice to the Prophet\n40. Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind or those clearly astray?\n41. Even if We take you away ˹from this world˺, We will surely inflict\npunishment upon them. 42. Or if We show you what We threaten them with,\nWe certainly have full power over them. 43. So hold firmly to what has\nbeen revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺. You are truly on the Straight Path. 44.\nSurely this ˹Quran˺ is a glory for you and your people. And you will ˹all˺ be\nquestioned ˹about it˺. 45. Ask ˹the followers of˺ the messengers that We\n\n-- 430 of 694 --\n\nalready sent before you if We ˹ever˺ appointed ˹other˺ gods to be\nworshipped besides the Most Compassionate.\nThe Case of Pharaoh’s People\n46. Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, and he\nsaid: “I am a messenger of the Lord of all worlds.” 47. But as soon as he\ncame to them with Our signs, they laughed at them, 48. although every sign\nWe showed them was greater than the one before.[1009] Ultimately, We\nseized them with torments so that they might return ˹to the Right Path˺.[1010]\n49. ˹Then˺ they pleaded, “O ˹mighty˺ magician! Pray to your Lord on our\nbehalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you.[1011] We will certainly\naccept guidance.” 50. But as soon as We removed the torments from them,\nthey broke their promise.\nPharaoh’s Arrogance\n51. And Pharaoh called out to his people, boasting, “O my people! Am I not\nsovereign over Egypt as well as ˹all˺ these streams[1012] flowing at my feet?\nCan you not see? 52. Am I not better than this nobody who can hardly\nexpress himself?[1013] 53. Why then have no golden bracelets ˹of kingship˺\nbeen granted to him or angels come with him as escorts!” 54. And so he\nfooled his people, and they obeyed him. They were truly a rebellious\npeople. 55. So when they enraged Us, We inflicted punishment upon them,\ndrowning them all. 56. And We made them an example and a lesson for\nthose after them.\nAll Objects of Worship in Hell?\n57. When the son of Mary was cited as an example ˹in argument˺, your\npeople ˹O Prophet˺ broke into ˹joyful˺ applause.[1014] 58. They exclaimed,\n“Which is better: our gods or Jesus?” They cite him only to argue. In fact,\nthey are a people prone to dispute. 59. He was only a servant We showed\nfavour to, and made as an example for the Children of Israel. 60. Had We\nwilled, We could have easily replaced you ˹all˺ with angels,[1015] succeeding\none another on earth. 61. And his ˹second˺ coming is truly a sign for the\nHour. So have no doubt about it, and follow me. This is the Straight Path.\n62. And do not let Satan hinder you, ˹for˺ he is certainly your sworn enemy.\nThe Truth About Jesus\n\n-- 431 of 694 --\n\n63. When Jesus came with clear proofs, he declared, “I have come to you\nwith wisdom, and to clarify to you some of what you differ about. So fear\nAllah, and obey me. 64. Surely Allah ˹alone˺ is my Lord and your Lord, so\nworship Him ˹alone˺. This is the Straight Path.” 65. Yet their ˹various˺\ngroups have differed among themselves ˹about him˺, so woe to the\nwrongdoers when they face the torment of a painful Day! 66. Are they\nwaiting for the Hour to take them by surprise when they least expect ˹it˺?\nReward of the Righteous\n67. Close friends will be enemies to one another on that Day, except the\nrighteous, 68. ˹who will be told,˺ “O My servants! There is no fear for you\nToday, nor will you grieve— 69. ˹those˺ who believed in Our signs and\n˹fully˺ submitted ˹to Us˺. 70. Enter Paradise, you and your spouses,\nrejoicing.” 71. Golden trays and cups will be passed around to them. There\nwill be whatever the souls desire and the eyes delight in. And you will be\nthere forever. 72. That is the Paradise which you will be awarded for what\nyou used to do. 73. There you will have abundant fruit[1016] to eat from.\nReward of the Wicked\n74. Indeed, the wicked will be in the torment of Hell forever. 75. It will\nnever be lightened for them, and there they will be overwhelmed with\ndespair. 76. We did not wrong them, but it was they who were the\nwrongdoers. 77. They will cry, “O Mâlik![1017] Let your Lord finish us off.”\nHe will answer, “You are definitely here to stay.” 78. We certainly brought\nthe truth to you, but most of you were resentful of the truth.\nWarning to the Polytheists\n79. Or have they mastered some ˹evil˺ plan? Then We ˹too˺ are surely\nplanning. 80. Or do they think that We do not hear their ˹evil˺ thoughts and\nsecret talks? Yes ˹We do˺! And Our messenger-angels are in their presence,\nrecording ˹it all˺. 81. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the Most Compassionate ˹really˺\nhad offspring, I would be the first worshipper.” 82. Glorified is the Lord of\nthe heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, far above what they\nclaim. 83. So let them indulge ˹in falsehood˺ and amuse ˹themselves˺ until\nthey face their Day, which they have been warned of.\nThe Only God Worthy of Worship\n\n-- 432 of 694 --\n\n84. It is He Who is ˹the only˺ God in the heavens and ˹the only˺ God on the\nearth. For He is the All-Wise, All-Knowing. 85. And Blessed is the One to\nWhom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in\nbetween! With Him ˹alone˺ is the knowledge of the Hour. And to Him you\nwill ˹all˺ be returned.\nCall to the Worshippers of False Gods\n86. ˹But˺ those ˹objects of worship˺ they invoke besides Him have no power\nto intercede, except those who testify to the truth knowingly.[1018] 87. If you\nask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created them, they will certainly say, “Allah!”\nHow can they then be deluded ˹from the truth˺? 88. ˹Allah is Aware of˺ the\nProphet’s cry: “O my Lord! Indeed, these are a people who persist in\ndisbelief.” 89. So bear with them and respond with peace. They will soon\ncome to know.\n***\n\n-- 433 of 694 --\n\n44. The Haze\n(Ad-Dukhân)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the haze (caused by drought), which\nis mentioned in verse 10. Similar to the previous sûrah, the Meccan pagans\nare equated with Pharaoh’s people for going back on their promise of full\nsubmission to Allah once the plague is removed from them. The Quran is\nsaid to have been revealed on a blessed night for the guidance of humanity.\nThose who embrace its guidance will be honoured in Paradise and those\nwho reject it will be debased in Hell. This fate is the underlying theme in the\nnext sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Quran as a Mercy\n1.\nḤâ-Mĩm. 2. By the clear Book! 3. Indeed, We sent it down on a blessed\nnight,[1019] for We always warn ˹against evil˺. 4. On that night every matter\nof wisdom is ordained 5. by a command from Us, for We have always sent\n˹messengers˺ 6. as a mercy from your Lord. He ˹alone˺ is truly the All-\nHearing, All-Knowing— 7. the Lord of the heavens and the earth and\neverything in between, if only you had sure faith. 8. There is no god\n˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He ˹alone˺ gives life and causes death. ˹He\nis˺ your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers.\nMeccans Warned of Famine[1020]\n9. In fact, they are in doubt, amusing themselves. 10. Wait then ˹O Prophet˺\nfor the day ˹when˺ the sky will be veiled in haze,[1021] clearly visible, 11.\noverwhelming the people. ˹They will cry,˺ “This is a painful torment. 12.\nOur Lord! Remove ˹this˺ torment from us, ˹and˺ we will certainly believe.”\n13. How can they be reminded when a messenger has already come to\nthem, making things clear, 14. then they turned away from him, saying, “A\nmadman, taught by others!”? 15. Indeed, We will remove ˹that˺ torment for\na while, and you ˹Meccans˺ will return ˹to disbelief˺. 16. ˹Then˺ on the Day\nWe will deal ˹you˺ the fiercest blow, We will surely inflict punishment.\nMoses and Pharaoh’s People\n\n-- 434 of 694 --\n\n17. Indeed, before them We tested Pharaoh’s people: a noble messenger\ncame to them, 18. ˹proclaiming,˺ “Hand over the servants of Allah to me.\n[1022] I am truly a trustworthy messenger to you. 19. And do not be arrogant\nwith Allah. I have certainly come to you with a compelling proof. 20. And\nindeed, I seek refuge with my Lord and your Lord so you do not stone me\n˹to death˺. 21. ˹But˺ if you do not believe me, then let me be.” 22.\nUltimately, he cried out to his Lord, “These are a wicked people!”\nTyrants Destroyed\n23. ˹Allah responded,˺ “Leave with My servants at night, for you will surely\nbe pursued. 24. And leave the sea parted, for they are certainly an army\nbound to drown.” 25. ˹Imagine˺ how many gardens and springs the\ntyrants[1023] left behind, 26. as well as ˹various˺ crops and splendid\nresidences, 27. and luxuries which they fully enjoyed. 28. So it was. And\nWe awarded it ˹all˺ to another people. 29. Neither heaven nor earth wept\nover them, nor was their fate delayed. 30. And We certainly delivered the\nChildren of Israel from the humiliating torment 31. of Pharaoh. He was\ntruly a tyrant, a transgressor. 32. And indeed, We chose the Israelites\nknowingly above the others. 33. And We showed them signs in which there\nwas a clear test.\nWarning to Deniers of Resurrection\n34. Indeed, these ˹Meccans˺ say, 35. “There is nothing beyond our first\ndeath, and we will never be resurrected. 36. Bring ˹back˺ our forefathers, if\nwhat you say is true.” 37. Are they superior to the people of Tubba’[1024]\nand those before them? We destroyed them ˹all˺, ˹for˺ they were truly\nwicked. 38. We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in\nbetween for sport. 39. We only created them for a purpose, but most of\nthese ˹pagans˺ do not know. 40. Surely the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision is the\ntime appointed for all— 41. the Day no kith or kin will be of benefit to\nanother whatsoever, nor will they be helped, 42. except those shown mercy\nby Allah. He is truly the Almighty, Most Merciful.\nThe Tree of Hell\n43. Surely ˹the fruit of˺ the tree of Zaqqûm[1025] 44. will be the food of the\nevildoer. 45. Like molten metal, it will boil in the bellies 46. like the boiling\nof hot water. 47. ˹It will be said,˺ “Seize them and drag them into the depths\n\n-- 435 of 694 --\n\nof the Hellfire. 48. Then pour over their heads the torment of boiling\nwater.” 49. ˹The wicked will be told,˺ “Taste this. You mighty, noble one!\n[1026] 50. This is truly what you ˹all˺ used to doubt.”\nThe Pleasures of Paradise\n51. Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure place, 52. amid Gardens and\nsprings, 53. dressed in fine silk and rich brocade, facing one another. 54. So\nit will be. And We will pair them to maidens with gorgeous eyes. 55. There\nthey will call for every fruit in serenity. 56. There they will never taste\ndeath, beyond the first death. And He will protect them from the\npunishment of the Hellfire— 57. as ˹an act of˺ grace from your Lord. That\nis ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.\nThe Quran Is Easy\n58. Indeed, We have made this ˹Quran˺ easy in your own language ˹O\nProphet˺ so perhaps they will be mindful. 59. Wait then! They too are\ncertainly waiting.\n***\n\n-- 436 of 694 --\n\n45. The Kneeling\n(Al-Jâthiyah)\nThis Meccan sûrah, which takes its name from the kneeling of every faith-\ncommunity on Judgment Day mentioned in verse 28, is critical of those who\nturn away from Allah’s revelations, deny the Resurrection, ridicule the\ntruth, and fail to appreciate Allah’s countless favours and marvels of\ncreation. The dreadful judgment of these deniers is featured in the last part\nof the sûrah. All these themes are emphasized in the next sûrah as well.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Signs\n1.\nḤâ-Mĩm. 2. The revelation of this Book is from Allah—the Almighty,\nAll-Wise. 3. Surely in ˹the creation of˺ the heavens and the earth are signs\nfor the believers. 4. And in your own creation, and whatever living beings\nHe dispersed, are signs for people of sure faith. 5. And ˹in˺ the alternation of\nthe day and the night, the provision[1027] sent down from the skies by Allah\n—reviving the earth after its death—and the shifting of the winds, are signs\nfor people of understanding. 6. These are Allah’s revelations which We\nrecite to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth. So what message will they believe in after\n˹denying˺ Allah and His revelations?\nWarning to the Deniers\n7. Woe to every sinful liar. 8. They hear Allah’s revelations recited to them,\nthen persist ˹in denial˺ arrogantly as if they did not hear them. So give them\ngood news of a painful punishment. 9. And whenever they learn anything of\nOur revelations, they make a mockery of it. It is they who will suffer a\nhumiliating punishment. 10. Awaiting them is Hell. Their ˹worldly˺ gains\nwill not be of any benefit to them whatsoever, nor will those protectors they\nhave taken besides Allah. And they will suffer a tremendous punishment.\n11. This ˹Quran˺ is ˹true˺ guidance. And those who deny their Lord’s\nrevelations will suffer the ˹worst˺ torment of agonizing pain.\nAllah’s Favours to Humanity\n\n-- 437 of 694 --\n\n12. Allah is the One Who has subjected the sea for you so that ships may\nsail upon it by His command, and that you may seek His bounty, and that\nperhaps you will be grateful. 13. He ˹also˺ subjected for you whatever is in\nthe heavens and whatever is on the earth—all by His grace. Surely in this\nare signs for people who reflect.\nAdvice to the Believers\n14. ˹O Prophet!˺ Tell the believers to forgive those who do not fear Allah’s\ndays ˹of torment˺, so that He will reward each group for what they used to\ncommit. 15. Whoever does good, it is to their own benefit. And whoever\ndoes evil, it is to their own loss. Then to your Lord you will ˹all˺ be\nreturned.\nDifferences Among the Israelites\n16. Indeed, We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, wisdom, and\nprophethood; granted them good, lawful provisions; and favoured them\nabove the others.[1028] 17. We ˹also˺ gave them clear commandments\nregarding ˹their˺ faith. But it was not until knowledge came to them that\nthey differed out of mutual envy.[1029] Surely your Lord will judge between\nthem on the Day of Judgment regarding their differences.\nAdvice to the Prophet\n18. Now We have set you ˹O Prophet˺ on the ˹clear˺ Way of faith. So follow\nit, and do not follow the desires of those who do not know ˹the truth˺. 19.\nThey certainly can be of no benefit to you against Allah whatsoever. Surely\nthe wrongdoers are patrons of each other, whereas Allah is the Patron of the\nrighteous. 20. This ˹Quran˺ is an insight for humanity—a guide and mercy\nfor people of sure faith.\nGood and Evil Are Not Equal\n21. Or do those who commit evil deeds ˹simply˺ think that We will make\nthem equal—in their life and after their death—to those who believe and do\ngood? How wrong is their judgment! 22. For Allah created the heavens and\nthe earth for a purpose, so that every soul may be paid back for what it has\ncommitted. And none will be wronged.\nThose Led by Desire\n23. Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ those who have taken their own desires as\ntheir god? ˹And so˺ Allah left them to stray knowingly, sealed their hearing\n\n-- 438 of 694 --\n\nand hearts, and placed a cover on their sight. Who then can guide them after\nAllah? Will you ˹all˺ not then be mindful?\nArguments of the Deniers of Resurrection\n24. And they argue, “There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die;\nothers are born. And nothing destroys us but ˹the passage of˺ time.” Yet\nthey have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this ˹claim˺. They only speculate.\n25. And whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, their only\nargument is to say: “Bring our forefathers back, if what you say is true!” 26.\nSay, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ gives you life, then causes you to die,\nthen will gather you ˹all˺ on the Day of Judgment, about which there is no\ndoubt. But most people do not know.”\nThe Judgment\n27. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. On\nthe Day the Hour will be established, the people of falsehood will then be in\n˹total˺ loss. 28. And you will see every faith-community on its knees. Every\ncommunity will be summoned to its record ˹of deeds˺. ˹They all will be\ntold,˺ “This Day you will be rewarded for what you used to do. 29. This\nrecord of Ours speaks the truth about you. Indeed, We always had your\ndeeds recorded ˹by the angels˺.”\nReward of the Believers\n30. As for those who believed and did good, their Lord will admit them into\nHis mercy. That is ˹truly˺ the absolute triumph.\nPunishment of the Disbelievers\n31. And as for those who disbelieved, ˹they will be told,˺ “Were My\nrevelations not recited to you, yet you acted arrogantly and were a wicked\npeople? 32. And whenever it was said ˹to you˺, ‘Surely Allah’s promise ˹of\njudgment˺ is true and there is no doubt about the Hour,’ you said\n˹mockingly˺, ‘We do not know what the Hour is! We think it is no more\nthan speculation, and we are not convinced ˹that it will ever come˺.’” 33.\nAnd the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds will unfold before them, and\nthey will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. 34. It will be said,\n“This Day We will neglect you as you neglected the meeting of this Day of\nyours! Your home will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers. 35. This is\nbecause you made a mockery of Allah’s revelations, and were deluded by\n\n-- 439 of 694 --\n\n˹your˺ worldly life.” So ˹from˺ that Day ˹on˺ they will not be taken out of\nthe Fire, nor will they be allowed to appease ˹their Lord˺.\nPraises to the Almighty\n36. So all praise is for Allah—Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth,\nLord of all worlds. 37. To Him belongs ˹all˺ Majesty in the heavens and the\nearth. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.\n***\n\n-- 440 of 694 --\n\n46. The Sand-Hills\n(Al-A\nḥqâf)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the sand-hills mentioned in verse 21\nin the story of the people of Hûd (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) who were destroyed for their\ndisbelief, even though they were far superior to the Arab pagans (verses 21-\n28). Again, Allah’s infinite power is contrasted with the powerlessness of\nthe idols. The pagan arguments against the Quran and the Resurrection are\nrefuted, and reference is made to a group of jinn who readily embraced the\ntruth once they heard the Prophet’s recitation of the Quran. The Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is urged to be patient, and reminded of the fate awaiting those who\nchallenge the truth at the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nA Message to Idolaters\n1.\nḤâ-Mĩm. 2. The revelation of this Book is from Allah—the Almighty,\nAll-Wise. 3. We only created the heavens and the earth and everything in\nbetween for a purpose and an appointed term. Yet the disbelievers are\nturning away from what they have been warned about. 4. Ask ˹them, O\nProphet˺, “Have you considered whatever ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah?\nShow me what they have created on earth! Or do they have a share in ˹the\ncreation of˺ the heavens? Bring me a scripture ˹revealed˺ before this ˹Quran˺\nor a shred of knowledge, if what you say is true.” 5. And who could be\nmore astray than those who call upon others besides Allah—˹others˺ that\ncannot respond to them until the Day of Judgment, and are ˹even˺ unaware\nof their calls? 6. And when ˹such˺ people will be gathered together, those\n˹gods˺ will be their enemies and will disown their worship.\nPagan Denial of the Quran\n7. Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, the disbelievers say\nof the truth when it has come to them, “This is pure magic.” 8. Or do they\nsay, “He[1030] has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If I have\ndone so, then there is nothing whatsoever you can do to save me from\nAllah. He knows best what ˹slurs˺ you indulge about it. Sufficient is He as a\n\n-- 441 of 694 --\n\nWitness between you and me. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”\n9. Say, “I am not the first messenger ever sent, nor do I know what will\nhappen to me or you. I only follow what is revealed to me. And I am only\nsent with a clear warning.”\nPagan Arrogance Towards Allah\n10. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Consider if this ˹Quran˺ is ˹truly˺ from Allah\nand you deny it, and a witness from the Children of Israel attests to it and\nthen believes,[1031] whereas you act arrogantly. Surely Allah does not guide\nthe wrongdoing people.”\nBelittling the Quran\n11. The disbelievers say of the believers, “Had it been ˹something˺ good,\nthey[1032] would not have beaten us to it.” Now since they reject its\nguidance, they will say, “˹This is˺ an ancient fabrication!” 12. And before\nthis ˹Quran˺ the Book of Moses was ˹revealed as˺ a guide and mercy. And\nthis Book is a confirmation, in the Arabic tongue, to warn those who do\nwrong, and as good news to those who do good.\nReward of the Devout\n13. Surely those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remain steadfast—\nthere will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. 14. It is they who will\nbe the residents of Paradise, staying there forever, as a reward for what they\nused to do.\nStance of the Faithful\n15. We have commanded people to honour their parents. Their mothers bore\nthem in hardship and delivered them in hardship. Their ˹period of˺ bearing\nand weaning is thirty months. In time, when the child reaches their prime at\nthe age of forty, they pray, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for\nYour favours which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do good\ndeeds that please You. And instil righteousness in my offspring. I truly\nrepent to You, and I truly submit ˹to Your Will˺.” 16. It is from these\n˹people˺ that We will accept the good they did, and overlook their misdeeds\n—along with the residents of Paradise, ˹in fulfilment of˺ the true promise\nthey have been given.\nStance of the Deniers\n\n-- 442 of 694 --\n\n17. But some scold their parents, “Enough with you! Are you warning me\nthat I will be brought forth ˹from the grave˺, while many generations had\nalready perished before me ˹for good˺?” The parents cry to Allah for help,\n˹and warn their child,˺ “Pity you. Have faith! Surely Allah’s promise is\ntrue.” But the deniers insist, “This is nothing but ancient fables.” 18. These\nare the ones against whom the fate of earlier communities of jinn and\nhumans has been justified, ˹for˺ they were truly losers.\nReward of the Faithful and the Deniers\n19. Each ˹of the two groups˺ will be ranked according to what they have\ndone so He may fully reward all. And none will be wronged. 20. ˹Watch\nfor˺ the Day ˹when˺ the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire. ˹They will\nbe told,˺ “You ˹already˺ exhausted your ˹share of˺ pleasures during your\nworldly life, and ˹fully˺ enjoyed them. So Today you will be rewarded with\nthe torment of disgrace for your arrogance throughout the land with no\nright, and for your rebelliousness.”\nProphet Hûd\n21. And remember the brother of ’Ȃd, when he warned his people, who\ninhabited the sand-hills[1033]—there were certainly warners before and after\nhim—˹saying,˺ “Worship none but Allah. I truly fear for you the torment of\na tremendous day.” 22. They argued, “Have you come to turn us away from\nour gods? Bring us then whatever you threaten us with, if what you say is\ntrue.” 23. He responded, “The knowledge ˹of its time˺ is only with Allah. I\nonly convey to you what I have been sent with. But I can see that you are a\npeople acting ignorantly.” 24. Then when they saw the torment as a ˹dense˺\ncloud approaching their valleys, they said ˹happily˺, “This is a cloud\nbringing us rain.” ˹But Hûd replied,˺ “No, it is what you sought to hasten: a\n˹fierce˺ wind carrying a painful punishment!” 25. It destroyed everything by\nthe command of its Lord, leaving nothing visible except their ruins. This is\nhow We reward the wicked people.\nWarning to Meccan Pagans\n26. Indeed, We had established them[1034] in a way We have not established\nyou ˹Meccans˺. And We gave them hearing, sight, and intellect. But neither\ntheir hearing, sight, nor intellect were of any benefit to them whatsoever,\nsince they persisted in denying Allah’s signs. And ˹so˺ they were\n\n-- 443 of 694 --\n\noverwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. 27. We certainly destroyed the\nsocieties around you after having varied the signs so perhaps they would\nreturn ˹to the Right Path˺. 28. Why then did those ˹idols˺ they took as gods\n—hoping to get closer ˹to Him˺—not come to their aid? Instead, they failed\nthem. That is ˹the result of˺ their lies and their fabrications.\nThe Jinn Listen to the Quran\n29. ˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when We sent a group of jinn your way to\nlisten to the Quran. Then, upon hearing it, they said ˹to one another˺,\n“Listen quietly!” Then when it was over, they returned to their fellow jinn\nas warners. 30. They declared, “O our fellow jinn! We have truly heard a\nscripture revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it. It guides to\nthe truth and the Straight Way. 31. O our fellow jinn! Respond to the caller\nof Allah and believe in him, He will forgive your sins and protect you from\na painful punishment. 32. And whoever does not respond to the caller of\nAllah will have no escape on earth, nor will they have any protectors\nagainst Him. It is they who are clearly astray.”\nWarning to Deniers of Resurrection\n33. Do they not realize that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth\nand did not tire in creating them,[1035] is able to give life to the dead? Yes\n˹indeed˺! He is certainly Most Capable of everything. 34. And on the Day\nthe disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire, ˹they will be asked,˺ “Is this\n˹Hereafter˺ not the truth?” They will cry, “Absolutely, by our Lord!” It will\nbe said, “Then taste the punishment for your disbelief.”\nAdvice to the Prophet\n35. So endure patiently, as did the Messengers of Firm Resolve.[1036] And\ndo not ˹seek to˺ hasten ˹the torment˺ for the deniers. On the Day they see\nwhat they have been threatened with, it will be as if they had only stayed ˹in\nthis world˺ for an hour of a day.[1037] ˹This is˺ a ˹sufficient˺ warning! Then,\nwill anyone be destroyed except the rebellious people?\n***\n\n-- 444 of 694 --\n\n47. Muḥammad\n(Muḥammad)\nThis Medinian sûrah, which takes its title from the Prophet’s name in verse\n2, discusses the etiquette of fighting in the battlefield. The faithful believers\nare promised different types of rivers and delicacies in Paradise, whereas\nthe disbelievers and the hypocrites are warned of an evil fate. To preserve\nthe reward of their good deeds, the believers are urged to strive in the Way\nof Allah and donate in His cause, culminating in the clear triumph in the\nnext sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nReward of the Believers and Disbelievers\n1. Those who disbelieve and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, He will\nrender their deeds void. 2. As for those who believe, do good, and have\nfaith in what has been revealed to Muḥammad—which is the truth from\ntheir Lord—He will absolve them of their sins and improve their condition.\n3. This is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, while the believers\nfollow the truth from their Lord. This is how Allah shows people their true\nstate ˹of faith˺.\nRules of Engagement[1038]\n4. So when you meet the disbelievers ˹in battle˺, strike ˹their˺ necks until\nyou have thoroughly subdued them, then bind them firmly. Later ˹free them\neither as˺ an act of grace or by ransom until the war comes to an end. So\nwill it be. Had Allah willed, He ˹Himself˺ could have inflicted punishment\non them. But He does ˹this only to˺ test some of you by means of others.\nAnd those who are martyred in the cause of Allah,[1039] He will never\nrender their deeds void. 5. He will guide them ˹to their reward˺, improve\ntheir condition, 6. and admit them into Paradise, having made it known to\nthem.[1040]\nWarning to the Deniers\n7. O believers! If you stand up for Allah, He will help you and make your\nsteps firm. 8. As for the disbelievers, may they be doomed and may He\n\n-- 445 of 694 --\n\nrender their deeds void. 9. That is because they detest what Allah has\nrevealed, so He has rendered their deeds void. 10. Have they not travelled\nthroughout the land to see what was the end of those before them? Allah\nannihilated them, and a similar fate awaits the disbelievers. 11. This is\nbecause Allah is the Patron of the believers while the disbelievers have no\npatron.\nThe Final Destination\n12. Surely Allah will admit those who believe and do good into Gardens\nunder which rivers flow. As for the disbelievers, they enjoy themselves and\nfeed like cattle.[1041] But the Fire will be their home.\nEvil Fate\n13. ˹Imagine, O Prophet,˺ how many societies We destroyed that were far\nsuperior in might than your society—which drove you out—and there was\nnone to help them! 14. Can those ˹believers˺ who stand on clear proof from\ntheir Lord be like those whose evil deeds are made appealing to them and\n˹only˺ follow their desires?\nDelights of Paradise\n15. The description of the Paradise promised to the righteous is that in it are\nrivers of fresh water, rivers of milk that never changes in taste, rivers of\nwine delicious to drink, and rivers of pure honey. There they will ˹also˺\nhave all kinds of fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord. ˹Can they be˺ like\nthose who will stay in the Fire forever, left to drink boiling water that will\ntear apart their insides?\nQualities of the Hypocrites 1) Mockery\n16. There are some of them who listen to you ˹O Prophet˺, but when they\ndepart from you, they say ˹mockingly˺ to those ˹believers˺ gifted with\nknowledge, “What did he just say?” These are the ones whose hearts Allah\nhas sealed and who ˹only˺ follow their desires. 17. As for those who are\n˹rightly˺ guided, He increases them in guidance and blesses them with\nrighteousness. 18. Are they only waiting for the Hour to take them by\nsurprise? Yet ˹some of˺ its signs have already come.[1042] Once it actually\nbefalls them, will it not be too late to be mindful?\nAdvice to the Prophet\n\n-- 446 of 694 --\n\n19. So, know ˹well, O Prophet,˺ that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺\nexcept Allah. And seek forgiveness for your shortcomings[1043] and for ˹the\nsins of˺ the believing men and women. For Allah ˹fully˺ knows your\nmovements and places of rest ˹O people˺.\nQualities of the Hypocrites 2) Cowardice\n20. And the believers say, “If only a sûrah was revealed ˹allowing self-\ndefence˺!” Yet when a precise sûrah is revealed, in which fighting is\n˹explicitly˺ mentioned, you see those with sickness in their hearts staring at\nyou like someone in the throes of death. It would have been better for them\n21. to obey and speak rightly. Then when fighting was ordained, it surely\nwould have been better for them if they were true to Allah. 22. Now if you\n˹hypocrites˺ turn away, perhaps you would then spread corruption\nthroughout the land and sever your ˹ties of˺ kinship![1044] 23. These are the\nones who Allah has condemned, deafening them and blinding their eyes.\n24. Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Or are there locks upon their\nhearts?\nWarning to Hypocrites\n25. Indeed, those who relapse ˹into disbelief˺ after ˹true˺ guidance has\nbecome clear to them, ˹it is˺ Satan ˹that˺ has tempted them, luring them with\nfalse hopes. 26. That is because they said ˹privately˺ to those who ˹also˺\ndetest what Allah has revealed, “We will obey you in some matters.”[1045]\nBut Allah ˹fully˺ knows what they are hiding. 27. Then how ˹horrible˺ will\nit be when the angels take their souls, beating their faces and backs! 28.\nThis is because they follow whatever displeases Allah and hate whatever\npleases Him, so He has rendered their deeds void.\nAnother Warning to Hypocrites\n29. Or do those with sickness in their hearts think that Allah will not ˹be\nable to˺ expose their malice? 30. Had We willed, We could have truly\nshown them to you ˹O Prophet˺, and you would have certainly recognized\nthem by their appearance. But you will surely recognize them by their tone\nof speech. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows your doings ˹O people˺.\nWisdom Behind the Test\n31. We will certainly test you ˹believers˺ until We prove those of you who\n˹truly˺ struggle ˹in Allah’s cause˺ and remain steadfast, and reveal how you\n\n-- 447 of 694 --\n\nconduct yourselves.\nReward of the Disbelievers\n32. Indeed, those who disbelieve, hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah,\nand defy the Messenger after ˹true˺ guidance has become clear to them; they\nwill not harm Allah in the least, but He will render their deeds void.\nAdvice to the Believers\n33. O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not let your\ndeeds be in vain. 34. Surely those who disbelieve, hinder ˹others˺ from the\nWay of Allah, and then die as disbelievers; Allah will never forgive them.\n35. So do not falter or cry for peace, for you will have the upper hand and\nAllah is with you. And He will never let your deeds go to waste.\nTest of Faith\n36. This worldly life is no more than play and amusement. But if you are\nfaithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, He will grant you your ˹full˺ reward, and\nwill not ask you ˹to donate all˺ your wealth. 37. If He were to do so and\npressure you, you would withhold and He would bring out your resentment.\n38. Here you are, being invited to donate ˹a little˺ in the cause of Allah. Still\nsome of you withhold. And whoever does so, it is only to their own loss.\nFor Allah is the Self-Sufficient, whereas you stand in need ˹of Him˺. If you\n˹still˺ turn away, He will replace you with another people. And they will not\nbe like you.\n***\n\n-- 448 of 694 --\n\n48. The Triumph\n(Al-Fat\nḥ)\nThis Medinian sûrah takes its name from the clear triumph (i.e., Treaty of\nḤudaibiyah) in verse 1. The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and 1400 of his companions\ntravelled to Mecca to perform the minor pilgrimage (’umrah) in 6 A.H./628\nC.E. He (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) sent ’Uthmân ibn ’Affân to let the Meccans know that the\nMuslims had come in peace, only to visit the Sacred House. When the\nMeccans delayed ’Uthmân, the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) thought they might have\nkilled his envoy. So he (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) called upon the faithful to pledge allegiance\nto him under a tree at\nḤudaibiyah in the outskirts of Mecca. Shortly after,\n’Uthmân returned safely and a peace agreement was signed by the Muslims\nand Meccan pagans, stating in part that the Muslims would have to return\nto Medina and come back next year for ’umrah. The Treaty of\nḤudaibiyah\nis described as a clear triumph since it established peace, temporarily\ndiffused the tension between the Muslims and the Meccan pagans, and gave\nthe Muslims plenty of time to spread awareness and understanding of their\nfaith. Thousands from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce. The\nsûrah commends the believers for proving true to Allah and His Messenger,\ncriticizes the hypocrites for not marching forth with the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص),\nand condemns the pagans for denying the believers access to the Sacred\nHouse. The description of the true believers both in the Torah and the\nGospel is given at the end of the sûrah, followed by instructions on proper\nconduct with the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and other believers in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nTreaty of\nḤudaibiyah\n1. Indeed, We have granted you a clear triumph ˹O Prophet˺ 2. so that Allah\nmay forgive you for your past and future shortcomings,[1046] perfect His\nfavour upon you, guide you along the Straight Path, 3. and so that Allah\nwill help you tremendously. 4. He is the One Who sent down serenity upon\nthe hearts of the believers so that they may increase even more in their faith.\nTo Allah ˹alone˺ belong the forces of the heavens and the earth. And Allah\nis All-Knowing, All-Wise. 5. So He may admit believing men and women\n\n-- 449 of 694 --\n\ninto Gardens under which rivers flow—to stay there forever—and absolve\nthem of their sins. And that is a supreme achievement in the sight of Allah.\n6. Also ˹so that˺ He may punish hypocrite men and women and polytheistic\nmen and women, who harbour evil thoughts of Allah.[1047] May ill-fate\nbefall them! Allah is displeased with them. He has condemned them and\nprepared for them Hell. What an evil destination! 7. To Allah ˹alone˺ belong\nthe forces of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.\nThe Prophet’s Duty\n8. Indeed, ˹O Prophet,˺ We have sent you as a witness, a deliverer of good\nnews, and a warner, 9. so that you ˹believers˺ may have faith in Allah and\nHis Messenger, support and honour him, and glorify Allah morning and\nevening.[1048]\nAllegiance Under the Tree[1049]\n10. Surely those who pledge allegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ are actually\npledging allegiance to Allah. Allah’s Hand is over theirs. Whoever breaks\ntheir pledge, it will only be to their own loss. And whoever fulfils their\npledge to Allah, He will grant them a great reward.\nFake Excuses for Not Travelling to Mecca\n11. The nomadic Arabs, who stayed behind, will say to you ˹O Prophet˺,\n“We were preoccupied with our wealth and families, so ask for forgiveness\nfor us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Who\nthen can stand between you and Allah in any way, if He intends harm or\nbenefit for you? In fact, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. 12. The truth is:\nyou thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to\ntheir families again. And that was made appealing in your hearts. You\nharboured evil thoughts ˹about Allah˺, and ˹so˺ became a doomed people.”\n13. And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, then We\nsurely have prepared for the disbelievers a blazing Fire. 14. To Allah ˹alone˺\nbelongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whoever He\nwills, and punishes whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful.\nShares in the Spoils of War\n15. Those who stayed behind will say, when you ˹believers˺ set out to take\nthe spoils of war, “Let us accompany you.” They wish to change Allah’s\n\n-- 450 of 694 --\n\npromise.[1050] Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “You will not accompany us. This is what\nAllah has said before.” They will then say, “In fact, you are driven by\njealousy against us!”[1051] The truth is: they can hardly comprehend.\nA Second Chance\n16. Say to nomadic Arabs, who stayed behind, “You will be called ˹to fight˺\nagainst a people of great might,[1052] who you will fight unless they submit.\nIf you then obey, Allah will grant you a fine reward. But if you turn away as\nyou did before, He will inflict upon you a painful punishment.”\nThose Exempted from Fighting\n17. There is no blame on the blind, or the disabled, or the sick ˹for staying\nbehind˺. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger will be admitted by\nHim into Gardens under which rivers flow. But whoever turns away will be\nsubjected by Him to a painful punishment.\nAllegiance of the Faithful\n18. Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged\nallegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ under the tree. He knew what was in their\nhearts, so He sent down serenity upon them and rewarded them with a\nvictory at hand,[1053] 19. and many spoils of war they will gain. For Allah is\nAlmighty, All-Wise. 20. Allah has promised you ˹believers˺ abundant\nspoils, which you will gain, so He hastened this ˹truce˺[1054] for you. And\nHe has held people’s hands back from ˹harming˺ you, so it may be a sign for\nthe believers, and so He may guide you along the Straight Path. 21. And\n˹there are˺ other gains which are beyond your reach that Allah is keeping in\nstore ˹for you˺. For Allah is Most Capable of everything.\nThe Believers Will Prevail\n22. If the disbelievers were to fight you, they would certainly flee.[1055]\nThen they would never find any protector or helper. 23. ˹This is˺ Allah’s\nway, already long established ˹in the past˺. And you will find no change in\nAllah’s way.\nWisdom Behind the Truce\n24. He is the One Who held back their hands from you and your hands from\nthem in the valley of ˹Ḥudaibiyah, near˺ Mecca, after giving you the upper\nhand over ˹a group of˺ them.[1056] And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.\n25. They are the ones who persisted in disbelief and hindered you from the\n\n-- 451 of 694 --\n\nSacred Mosque, preventing the sacrificial animals from reaching their\ndestination.[1057] ˹We would have let you march through Mecca,˺ had there\nnot been believing men and women, unknown to you. You might have\ntrampled them underfoot, incurring guilt for ˹what you did to˺ them\nunknowingly. That was so Allah may admit into His mercy whoever He\nwills.[1058] Had those ˹unknown˺ believers stood apart, We would have\ncertainly inflicted a painful punishment on the disbelievers.\nMeccan Arrogance\n26. ˹Remember˺ when the disbelievers had filled their hearts with pride—\nthe pride of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance[1059]—then Allah sent down His\nserenity upon His Messenger and the believers, inspiring them to uphold the\ndeclaration of faith,[1060] for they were better entitled and more worthy of it.\nAnd Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.\nThe Prophet’s Vision[1061]\n27. Indeed, Allah will fulfil His Messenger’s vision in all truth: Allah\nwilling, you will surely enter the Sacred Mosque, in security—˹some with˺\nheads shaved and ˹others with˺ hair shortened—without fear.[1062] He knew\nwhat you did not know, so He first granted you the triumph at hand.[1063]\n28. He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with ˹right˺ guidance and\nthe religion of truth, making it prevail over all others. And sufficient is\nAllah as a Witness.\nBelievers’ Description in the Torah and the Gospel\n29. Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those with him are firm\nwith the disbelievers[1064] and compassionate with one another. You see\nthem bowing and prostrating[1065] ˹in prayer˺, seeking Allah’s bounty and\npleasure. The sign ˹of brightness can be seen˺ on their faces from the trace\nof prostrating ˹in prayer˺. This is their description in the Torah.[1066] And\ntheir parable in the Gospel is that of a seed that sprouts its ˹tiny˺ branches,\nmaking it strong. Then it becomes thick, standing firmly on its stem, to the\ndelight of the planters[1067]—in this way Allah makes the believers a source\nof dismay for the disbelievers.[1068] To those of them who believe and do\ngood, Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward.\n***\n\n-- 452 of 694 --\n\n49. The Private Quarters\n(Al-\nḤujurât)\nThis Medinian sûrah, which takes its name from the reference to the\nProphet’s private quarters in verse 4, instructs the believers on the proper\nconduct towards the Prophet (verses 1-5) and the social etiquette of dealing\nwith other believers (verses 6-12) and the rest of humanity (verse 13). At the\nend of the sûrah, the nomadic Arabs are taught that true faith is proven by\naction not only words.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nManners with the Prophet 1) Respect Authority\n1. O believers! Do not proceed ˹in any matter˺ before ˹a decree from˺ Allah\nand His Messenger. And fear Allah. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-\nKnowing.\nManners with the Prophet 2) Watch Your Tongue\n2. O believers! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor\nspeak loudly to him as you do to one another,[1069] or your deeds will\nbecome void while you are unaware. 3. Indeed, those who lower their\nvoices in the presence of Allah’s Messenger are the ones whose hearts\nAllah has refined for righteousness. They will have forgiveness and a great\nreward.\nManners with the Prophet 3) Respect Privacy\n4. Indeed, most of those who call out to you ˹O Prophet˺ from outside ˹your˺\nprivate quarters have no understanding ˹of manners˺.[1070] 5. Had they been\npatient until you could come out to them, it would have certainly been\nbetter for them. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nSocial Etiquette 1) Verifying News\n6. O believers, if an evildoer brings you any news, verify ˹it˺ so you do not\nharm people unknowingly, becoming regretful for what you have done.[1071]\n7. And keep in mind that Allah’s Messenger is ˹still˺ in your midst. If he\nwere to yield to you in many matters, you would surely suffer ˹the\nconsequences˺.[1072] But Allah has endeared faith to you, making it\n\n-- 453 of 694 --\n\nappealing in your hearts. And He has made disbelief, rebelliousness, and\ndisobedience detestable to you. Those are the ones rightly guided. 8. ˹This\nis˺ a bounty and a blessing from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-\nWise.\nSocial Etiquette 2) Sense of Brotherhood\n9. And if two groups of believers fight each other, then make peace between\nthem. But if one of them transgresses against the other, then fight against\nthe transgressing group until they ˹are willing to˺ submit to the rule of\nAllah. If they do so, then make peace between both ˹groups˺ in all fairness\nand act justly. Surely Allah loves those who uphold justice. 10. The\nbelievers are but one brotherhood, so make peace between your brothers.\nAnd be mindful of Allah so you may be shown mercy.\nSocial Etiquette 3) Respect for All\n11. O believers! Do not let some ˹men˺ ridicule others, they may be better\nthan them, nor let ˹some˺ women ridicule other women, they may be better\nthan them. Do not defame one another, nor call each other by offensive\nnicknames. How evil it is to act rebelliously after having faith! And\nwhoever does not repent, it is they who are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers. 12. O\nbelievers! Avoid many suspicions, ˹for˺ indeed, some suspicions are sinful.\nAnd do not spy, nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the\nflesh of their dead brother? You would despise that![1073] And fear Allah.\nSurely Allah is ˹the˺ Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.\nSocial Etiquette 4) Equality\n13. O humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and\nmade you into peoples and tribes so that you may ˹get to˺ know one another.\nSurely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous\namong you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware.[1074]\nActions Speak Louder than Words\n14. ˹Some of˺ the nomadic Arabs say, “We believe.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “You\nhave not believed. But say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet\nentered your hearts.[1075] But if you obey Allah and His Messenger\n˹wholeheartedly˺, He will not discount anything from ˹the reward of˺ your\ndeeds. Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” 15. The ˹true˺ believers\nare only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger—never doubting—\n\n-- 454 of 694 --\n\nand strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah. They are\nthe ones true in faith. 16. Say, “Do you inform Allah of your faith, when\nAllah ˹already˺ knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the\nearth? And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.” 17. They regard\ntheir acceptance of Islam as a favour to you. Tell ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Do\nnot regard your Islam as a favour to me. Rather, it is Allah Who has done\nyou a favour by guiding you to the faith, if ˹indeed˺ you are faithful. 18.\nSurely Allah knows the unseen of the heavens and earth. And Allah is All-\nSeeing of what you do.”\n***\n\n-- 455 of 694 --\n\n50. Qãf\n(Qãf)\nSince the previous sûrah primarily addresses the believers, this sûrah\nmainly talks about the disbelievers—particularly the deniers of\nresurrection. References are made to earlier destroyed deniers and Allah’s\ninfinite power to prove His ability to create and resurrect. The deniers of\nresurrection are told what to expect after death and judgment. The Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is urged to be steadfast. The certainty of the Hereafter is\nemphasized both at the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nPagan Denial of Resurrection\n1. Qãf. By the glorious Quran! 2. ˹All will be resurrected,˺ yet the deniers\nare astonished that a warner has come to them from among themselves\n˹warning of resurrection˺. So the disbelievers say, “This is an astonishing\nthing! 3. ˹Will we be returned to life,˺ when we are dead and reduced to\ndust? Such a return is impossible.” 4. We certainly know what the earth\nconsumes of them ˹after their death˺, and with us is a well-preserved\nRecord.[1076] 5. In fact, they reject the truth when it has come to them, so\nthey are in a confused state.[1077]\nAllah’s Power to Create\n6. Have they not then looked at the sky above them: how We built it and\nadorned it ˹with stars˺, leaving it flawless? 7. As for the earth, We spread it\nout and placed upon it firm mountains, and produced in it every type of\npleasant plant— 8. ˹all as˺ an insight and a reminder to every servant who\nturns ˹to Allah˺. 9. And We send down blessed rain from the sky, bringing\nforth gardens and grains for harvest, 10. and towering palm trees ˹loaded˺\nwith clustered fruit, 11. ˹as˺ a provision for ˹Our˺ servants. And with this\n˹rain˺ We revive a lifeless land. Similar is the emergence ˹from the graves˺.\nDeniers Before Arab Pagans\n12. Before them, the people of Noah denied ˹the truth,˺ as did the people of\nthe Water-pit,[1078] Thamûd, 13. ’Ȃd, Pharaoh, the kinfolk of Lot, 14. the\n\n-- 456 of 694 --\n\nresidents of the Forest,[1079] and the people of Tubba’.[1080] Each rejected\n˹their˺ messenger, so My warning was fulfilled.\nAllah’s Power to Resurrect and Know All\n15. Were We incapable of creating ˹them˺ the first time? In fact, they are in\ndoubt about ˹their˺ re-creation. 16. Indeed, ˹it is˺ We ˹Who˺ created\nhumankind and ˹fully˺ know what their souls whisper to them, and We are\ncloser to them than ˹their˺ jugular vein. 17. As the two recording-angels—\n˹one˺ sitting to the right, and ˹the other to˺ the left—note ˹everything˺, 18.\nnot a word does a person utter without having a ˹vigilant˺ observer ready ˹to\nwrite it down˺.[1081]\nBad News for the Deniers\n19. ˹Ultimately,˺ with the throes of death will come the truth.[1082] This is\nwhat you were trying to escape! 20. And the Trumpet will be blown.[1083]\nThis is the Day ˹you were˺ warned of. 21. Each soul will come forth with an\nangel to drive it and another to testify. 22. ˹It will be said to the denier,˺\n“You were totally heedless of this. Now We have lifted this veil of yours, so\nToday your sight is sharp!” 23. And one’s accompanying-angel will say,\n“Here is the record ready with me.” 24. ˹It will be said to both angels,˺\n“Throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever, 25. withholder of good,\ntransgressor, and doubter, 26. who set up another god with Allah. So cast\nthem into the severe punishment.”\nThe Misleaders and the Misled\n27. One’s ˹devilish˺ associate will say, “Our Lord! I did not make them\ntransgress. Rather, they were far astray ˹on their own˺.” 28. Allah will\nrespond, “Do not dispute in My presence, since I had already given you a\nwarning. 29. My Word cannot be changed,[1084] nor am I unjust to ˹My˺\ncreation.” 30. ˹Beware of˺ the Day We will ask Hell, “Are you full ˹yet˺?”\nAnd it will respond, “Are there any more?”\nGood News for the Righteous\n31. And Paradise will be brought near to the righteous, not far off. 32. ˹And\nit will be said to them,˺ “This is what you were promised, for whoever\n˹constantly˺ turned ˹to Allah˺ and kept up ˹His commandments˺— 33. who\nwere in awe of the Most Compassionate without seeing ˹Him˺,[1085] and\nhave come with a heart turning ˹only to Him˺. 34. Enter it in peace. This is\n\n-- 457 of 694 --\n\nthe Day of eternal life!” 35. There they will have whatever they desire, and\nwith Us is ˹even˺ more.[1086]\nWarning to Meccan Pagans\n36. ˹Imagine˺ how many peoples We destroyed before them, who were far\nmightier than them. Then ˹when the torment came,˺ they ˹desperately˺\nsought refuge in the land. ˹But˺ was there any escape? 37. Surely in this is a\nreminder for whoever has a ˹mindful˺ heart and lends an attentive ear.\nDid Allah Get Tired?\n38. Indeed, We created the heavens and the earth and everything in between\nin six Days,[1087] and We were not ˹even˺ touched with fatigue.[1088] 39. So\nbe patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And glorify the praises of your\nLord before sunrise and before sunset. 40. And glorify Him during part of\nthe night[1089] and after the prayers.\nReassuring the Prophet\n41. And listen! On the Day the caller will call out from a near place, 42. the\nDay all will hear the ˹mighty˺ Blast in ˹all˺ truth,[1090] that will be the Day\nof emergence ˹from the graves˺. 43. It is certainly We Who give life and\ncause death. And to Us is the final return. 44. ˹Beware of˺ the Day the earth\nwill split open, letting them rush forth. That will be an easy gathering for\nUs. 45. We know best what they say. And you ˹O Prophet˺ are not ˹there˺ to\ncompel them ˹to believe˺. So remind with the Quran ˹only˺ those who fear\nMy warning.\n***\n\n-- 458 of 694 --\n\n51. Scattering Winds\n(Aⱬ-\nⱫâriyât)\nLike the previous sûrah, this Meccan sûrah makes the case for the\nResurrection, citing some of Allah’s natural signs in the universe to prove\nHis ability to bring the dead back life. Several examples are given of the\ndeniers of judgment who were destroyed, which contrast with the reward of\nthe believers. The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is urged to carry on reminding. Both\nthe end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next pose a warning of the\nDay of Judgment.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nJudgment Is Inevitable\n1. By the winds scattering ˹dust˺, 2. and ˹the clouds˺ loaded with rain, 3. and\n˹the ships˺ gliding with ease, 4. and ˹the angels˺ administering affairs by\n˹Allah’s˺ command! 5. Indeed, what you are promised is true. 6. And the\nJudgment will certainly come to pass.\nWarning to the Deniers\n7. ˹And˺ by the heavens in their marvellous design![1091] 8. Surely you are\n˹lost˺ in conflicting views ˹regarding the truth˺.[1092] 9. Only those ˹destined\nto be˺ deluded are turned away from it.[1093] 10. Condemned are the liars—\n11. those who are ˹steeped˺ in ignorance, totally heedless. 12. They ask\n˹mockingly˺, “When is this Day of Judgment?” 13. ˹It is˺ the Day they will\nbe tormented over the Fire. 14. ˹They will be told,˺ “Taste your torment!\nThis is what you sought to hasten.”\nGood News for the Devout\n15. Indeed, the righteous will be amid Gardens and springs, 16. ˹joyfully˺\nreceiving what their Lord will grant them. Before this ˹reward˺ they were\ntruly good-doers ˹in the world˺: 17. they used to sleep only little in the\nnight, 18. and pray for forgiveness before dawn.[1094] 19. And in their\nwealth there was a rightful share ˹fulfilled˺ for the beggar and the poor.\nAllah’s Signs in Creation\n\n-- 459 of 694 --\n\n20. There are ˹countless˺ signs on earth for those with sure faith, 21. as there\nare within yourselves. Can you not see? 22. In heaven is your sustenance\nand whatever you are promised. 23. Then by the Lord of heaven and earth!\n˹All˺ this is certainly as true as ˹the fact that˺ you can speak!\nAbraham Visited by Angels\n24. Has the story of Abraham’s honoured guests reached you ˹O Prophet˺?\n25. ˹Remember˺ when they entered his presence and greeted ˹him with˺,\n“Peace!” He replied, “Peace ˹be upon you˺!” ˹Then he said to himself,˺\n“˹These are˺ an unfamiliar people.” 26. Then he slipped off to his family\nand brought a fat ˹roasted˺ calf,[1095] 27. and placed it before them, asking,\n“Will you not eat?” 28. ˹They did not eat,˺ so he grew fearful of them.[1096]\nThey reassured ˹him˺, “Do not be afraid,” and gave him good news of a\nknowledgeable son.[1097] 29. Then his wife came forward with a cry,\nclasping her forehead ˹in astonishment˺, exclaiming, “˹A baby from˺ a\nbarren, old woman!” 30. They replied, “Such has your Lord decreed. He is\ntruly the All-Wise, All-Knowing.”\nDestruction of the People of Lot\n31. ˹Later,˺ Abraham asked, “What is your mission, O messengers?” 32.\nThey replied, “We have actually been sent to a wicked people, 33. to send\nupon them stones of ˹baked˺ clay, 34. marked by your Lord for the\ntransgressors.” 35. Then ˹before the torment˺ We evacuated the believers\nfrom the city. 36. But We only found one family that had submitted ˹to\nAllah˺.[1098] 37. And We have left a sign there[1099] ˹as a lesson˺ for those\nwho fear the painful punishment.\nDestruction of Pharaoh’s People\n38. And in ˹the story of˺ Moses ˹was another lesson,˺ when We sent him to\nPharaoh with compelling proof, 39. but Pharaoh was carried away by his\npower, saying ˹of Moses˺, “A magician or a madman!” 40. So We seized\nhim and his soldiers, casting them into the sea while he was blameworthy.\n[1100]\nDestruction of the People of Hûd\n41. And in ˹the story of˺ ’Âd ˹was another lesson,˺ when We sent against\nthem the devastating wind.[1101] 42. There was nothing it came upon that it\ndid not reduce to ashes.\n\n-- 460 of 694 --\n\nDestruction of the People of\nṢâli\nḥ\n43. And in ˹the story of˺ Thamûd ˹was another lesson,˺ when they were told,\n“Enjoy yourselves ˹only˺ for a ˹short˺ while.”[1102] 44. Still they persisted in\ndefying the commands of their Lord, so they were overtaken by a ˹mighty˺\nblast while they were looking on. 45. Then they were not able to rise up,\nnor were they helped.\nDestruction of the People of Noah\n46. And the people of Noah ˹had also been destroyed˺ earlier. They were\ntruly a rebellious people.\nAllah’s Power of Creation\n47. We built the universe with ˹great˺ might, and We are certainly\nexpanding ˹it˺. 48. As for the earth, We spread it out. How superbly did We\nsmooth it out![1103] 49. And We created pairs of all things[1104] so perhaps\nyou would be mindful.\nWake-up Call to the Deniers\n50. So ˹proclaim, O Prophet˺: “Flee to Allah! I am truly sent by Him with a\nclear warning to you. 51. And do not set up another god with Allah. I am\ntruly sent by Him with a clear warning to you.”\nEarlier Deniers\n52. Similarly, no messenger came to those before them without being told:\n“A magician or a madman!” 53. Have they passed this ˹cliché˺ down to one\nanother? In fact, they have ˹all˺ been a transgressing people. 54. So ˹now˺\nturn away from them ˹O Prophet˺, for you will not be blamed.[1105] 55. But\n˹continue to˺ remind. For certainly reminders benefit the believers.\nThe Purpose of Life\n56. I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me. 57. I seek no\nprovision from them, nor do I need them to feed Me. 58. Indeed, Allah\n˹alone˺ is the Supreme Provider—Lord of all Power, Ever Mighty.\nWarning to the Deniers\n59. The wrongdoers will certainly have a share ˹of the torment˺ like that of\ntheir predecessors. So do not let them ask Me to hasten ˹it˺. 60. Woe then to\nthe disbelievers when they face their Day which they are warned of!\n***\n\n-- 461 of 694 --\n\n52. Mount Ṭûr\n(Aṭ-\nṬûr)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from verse 1, where Allah swears by\nMount\nṬûr, among other things, that the Day of Judgment is inevitable. The\npunishment of those skeptical of judgment is described, followed by a\ndetailed description of the reward of the believers along with their offspring\n(verses17-28). Atheism is also rejected (verses 25-36). The Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reassured of Allah’s support, while the pagan beliefs and\narguments are refuted both in this sûrah and the next.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nJudgment Is the Truth\n1. By Mount Ṭûr![1106] 2. And by the Book written 3. on open pages ˹for all\nto read˺![1107] 4. And by the ˹Sacred˺ House frequently visited![1108] 5. And\nby the canopy raised ˹high˺! 6. And by the seas set on fire![1109] 7. Indeed,\nthe punishment of your Lord will come to pass— 8. none will avert it— 9.\non the Day the heavens will be shaken violently, 10. and the mountains will\nbe blown away entirely.\nHorrors Awaiting the Deniers\n11. Then woe on that Day to the deniers— 12. those who amuse themselves\nwith falsehood! 13. ˹It is˺ the Day they will be fiercely shoved into the Fire\nof Hell. 14. ˹They will be told,˺ “This is the Fire which you used to deny.\n15. Is this magic, or do you not see? 16. Burn in it! It is the same whether\nyou endure ˹it˺ patiently or not.[1110] You are only rewarded for what you\nused to do.”\nPleasures Awaiting the Faithful\n17. Indeed, the righteous will be in Gardens and bliss, 18. enjoying\nwhatever their Lord will have granted them. And their Lord will have\nprotected them from the torment of the Hellfire. 19. ˹They will be told,˺\n“Eat and drink happily for what you used to do.” 20. They will be reclining\non thrones, ˹neatly˺ lined up ˹facing each other˺. And We will pair them to\nmaidens with gorgeous eyes. 21. As for those who believe and whose\n\n-- 462 of 694 --\n\ndescendants follow them in faith, We will elevate their descendants to their\nrank, never discounting anything ˹of the reward˺ of their deeds. Every\nperson will reap only what they sowed.[1111] 22. And We will ˹continually˺\nprovide them with whatever fruit or meat they desire. 23. They will pass\naround to each other a drink ˹of pure wine,˺ which leads to no idle talk or\nsinfulness. 24. And they will be waited on by their youthful servants like\nspotless pearls.\nRemembering Past Lives in Paradise\n25. They will turn to one another inquisitively.[1112] 26. They will say,\n“Before ˹this reward˺ we used to be in awe ˹of Allah˺ in the midst of our\npeople. 27. So Allah has graced us and protected us from the torment of\n˹Hell’s˺ scorching heat. 28. Indeed, we used to call upon Him ˹alone˺ before.\nHe is truly the Most Kind, Most Merciful.”\nWhy Do Meccans Deny the Truth?\n29. So ˹continue to˺ remind ˹all, O Prophet˺. For you, by the grace of your\nLord, are not a fortune-teller or a madman. 30. Or do they say, “˹He is˺ a\npoet, for whom we ˹eagerly˺ await an ill-fate!”? 31. Say, “Keep waiting! I\ntoo am waiting with you.” 32. Or do their ˹intelligent˺ minds prompt them\nto this ˹paradox˺?[1113] Or are they ˹just˺ a transgressing people? 33. Or do\nthey say, “He made this ˹Quran˺ up!”? In fact, they have no faith. 34. Let\nthem then produce something like it, if what they say is true![1114] 35. Or\nwere they created by nothing, or are they ˹their own˺ creators? 36. Or did\nthey create the heavens and the earth? In fact, they have no firm belief ˹in\nAllah˺. 37. Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord, or are they in\ncontrol ˹of everything˺? 38. Or do they have a stairway, by which they\neavesdrop ˹on the heavens˺? Then let those who do so bring a compelling\nproof. 39. Or does He have daughters ˹as you claim˺, while you ˹prefer to˺\nhave sons?[1115] 40. Or are you ˹O Prophet˺ asking them for a reward ˹for\nthe message˺ so that they are overburdened by debt? 41. Or do they have\naccess to ˹the Record in˺ the unseen, so they copy it ˹for all to see˺? 42. Or\ndo they intend to scheme ˹against the Prophet˺? Then it is the disbelievers\nwho will fall victim to ˹their˺ schemes. 43. Or do they have a god other than\nAllah? Glorified is Allah far above what they associate ˹with Him˺!\nReassuring the Prophet\n\n-- 463 of 694 --\n\n44. If they were to see a ˹deadly˺ piece of the sky fall down ˹upon them˺,\nstill they would say, “˹This is just˺ a pile of clouds.” 45. So leave them until\nthey face their Day in which they will be struck dead— 46. the Day their\nscheming will be of no benefit to them whatsoever, nor will they be helped.\n47. Also, the wrongdoers will certainly have another torment before that\n˹Day˺, but most of them do not know.[1116] 48. So be patient with your\nLord’s decree, for you are truly under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes. And glorify the\npraises of your Lord when you rise. 49. And glorify Him during part of the\nnight and at the fading of the stars.\n***\n\n-- 464 of 694 --\n\n53. The Stars\n(An-Najm)\nThis Meccan sûrah takes its name from the reference to the fading of the\nstars in the first verse (as well as the last verse of the previous sûrah). The\ndivine source of the Prophet’s message is emphasized, followed by reference\nto his ascension to heaven during the Night Journey (see the introduction to\nSûrah 17). The pagans are condemned for associating idols with Allah in\nworship and for claiming that the angels are Allah’s daughters.\nManifestations of Allah’s infinite power are cited to prove His ability to\nresurrect. Both the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next stress the\nimminence of the Hour.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Prophet’s Encounter with Gabriel\n1. By the stars when they fade away! 2. Your fellow man[1117] is neither\nmisguided nor astray. 3. Nor does he speak of his own whims. 4. It is only a\nrevelation sent down ˹to him˺. 5. He has been taught by one ˹angel˺ of\nmighty power[1118] 6. and great perfection, who once rose to ˹his˺ true\nform[1119] 7. while on the highest point above the horizon, 8. then he\napproached ˹the Prophet˺, coming so close 9. that he was only two arms-\nlengths away or even less.[1120] 10. Then Allah revealed to His servant what\nHe revealed ˹through Gabriel˺. 11. The ˹Prophet’s˺ heart did not doubt what\nhe saw. 12. How can you ˹O pagans˺ then dispute with him regarding what\nhe saw? 13. And he certainly saw that ˹angel descend˺ a second time 14. at\nthe Lote Tree of the most extreme limit ˹in the seventh heaven˺— 15. near\nwhich is the Garden of ˹Eternal˺ Residence— 16. while the Lote Tree was\noverwhelmed with ˹heavenly˺ splendours! 17. The ˹Prophet’s˺ sight never\nwandered, nor did it overreach. 18. He certainly saw some of his Lord’s\ngreatest signs.[1121]\nWake-up Call to Pagans\n19. Now, have you considered ˹the idols of˺ Lât and ’Uzza, 20. and the third\none, Manât, as well? 21. Do you ˹prefer to˺ have sons while ˹you attribute˺\n\n-- 465 of 694 --\n\nto Him daughters?[1122] 22. Then this is ˹truly˺ a biased distribution! 23.\nThese ˹idols˺ are mere names that you and your forefathers have made\nup[1123]—a practice Allah has never authorized. They follow nothing but\n˹inherited˺ assumptions and whatever ˹their˺ souls desire, although ˹true˺\nguidance has already come to them from their Lord. 24. Or should every\nperson ˹simply˺ have whatever ˹intercessors˺ they desire?[1124] 25. In fact, to\nAllah ˹alone˺ belongs this world and the next. 26. ˹Imagine˺ how many\n˹noble˺ angels are in the heavens! ˹Even˺ their intercession would be of no\nbenefit whatsoever, until Allah gives permission to whoever He wills and\n˹only for the people He˺ approves.\nAre Angels Allah’s Daughters?\n27. Indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter label angels as\nfemale, 28. although they have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this. They\nfollow nothing but ˹inherited˺ assumptions. And surely assumptions can in\nno way replace the truth. 29. So turn away ˹O Prophet˺ from whoever has\nshunned Our Reminder,[1125] only seeking the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world.\n30. This is the extent of their knowledge. Surely your Lord knows best who\nhas strayed from His Way and who is ˹rightly˺ guided.\nAllah Knows Who Is Righteous\n31. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on\nthe earth so that He may reward the evildoers according to what they did,\nand reward the good-doers with the finest reward[1126]— 32. those who\navoid major sins and shameful deeds, despite ˹stumbling on˺ minor sins.\nSurely your Lord is infinite in forgiveness. He knew well what would\nbecome of you as He created you from the earth[1127] and while you were\n˹still˺ fetuses in the wombs of your mothers.[1128] So do not ˹falsely˺ elevate\nyourselves. He knows best who is ˹truly˺ righteous.\nThe One Who Returned to Disbelief[1129]\n33. Have you seen the one who turned away ˹from Islam,˺ 34. and ˹initially˺\npaid a little ˹for his salvation˺, and then stopped? 35. Does he have the\nknowledge of the unseen so that he sees ˹the Hereafter˺? 36. Or has he not\nbeen informed of what is in the Scripture of Moses, 37. and ˹that of˺\nAbraham, who ˹perfectly˺ fulfilled ˹his covenant˺? 38. ˹They state˺ that no\nsoul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another, 39. and that each\n\n-- 466 of 694 --\n\nperson will only have what they endeavoured towards, 40. and that ˹the\noutcome of˺ their endeavours will be seen ˹in their record˺, 41. then they\nwill be fully rewarded, 42. and that to your Lord ˹alone˺ is the ultimate\nreturn ˹of all things˺.\nIt Is All in Allah’s Hands\n43. Moreover, He is the One Who brings about joy and sadness.[1130] 44.\nAnd He is the One Who gives life and causes death. 45. And He created the\npairs—males and females— 46. from a sperm-drop when it is emitted. 47.\nAnd it is upon Him to bring about re-creation. 48. And He is the One Who\nenriches and impoverishes. 49. And He alone is the Lord of Sirius.[1131] 50.\nAnd He destroyed the first ˹people of˺ ’Ȃd, 51. and ˹then˺ Thamûd,[1132]\nsparing no one. 52. And before ˹that He destroyed˺ the people of Noah, who\nwere truly far worse in wrongdoing and transgression. 53. And ˹it was˺ He\n˹Who˺ turned the cities ˹of Sodom and Gomorrah˺ upside down. 54. How\noverwhelming was what covered ˹them˺![1133] 55. Now, which of your\nLord’s favours will you dispute?\nWarning to Arab Pagans\n56. This ˹Prophet˺ is a warner like earlier ones. 57. The approaching ˹Hour˺\nhas drawn near. 58. None but Allah can disclose it. 59. Do you find this\nrevelation astonishing, 60. laughing ˹at it˺ and not weeping ˹in awe˺, 61.\nwhile persisting in heedlessness? 62. Instead, prostrate to Allah and worship\n˹Him alone˺!\n***\n\n-- 467 of 694 --\n\n54. The Moon\n(Al-Qamar)\nThis Meccan sûrah, which takes its name from the splitting of the moon\nmentioned in verse 1, criticizes the disbelievers for rejecting warnings of\nthe fast-approaching Hour. The pagans are warned of a dreadful fate\nsimilar to that of earlier disbelievers, who were mentioned passingly in the\nprevious sûrah (53:50-54). The sûrah concludes by announcing that the\nrighteous will be honoured in the presence of the Almighty, which is the\nhighlight of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWarning to Meccan Deniers\n1. The Hour has drawn near and the moon was split ˹in two˺.[1134] 2. Yet,\nwhenever they see a sign, they turn away,[1135] saying, “Same old magic!”\n3. They rejected ˹the truth˺ and followed their own desires—and every\nmatter will be settled— 4. even though the stories ˹of destroyed nations˺\nthat have already come to them are a sufficient deterrent. 5. ˹This Quran is˺\nprofound ˹in˺ wisdom, but warnings are of no benefit ˹to them˺. 6. So turn\naway from them ˹O Prophet˺. ˹And wait for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the caller[1136]\nwill summon ˹them˺ for something horrifying.[1137] 7. With eyes downcast,\nthey will come forth from the graves as if they were swarming locusts, 8.\nrushing towards the caller. The disbelievers will cry, “This is a difficult\nDay!”\nThe People of Noah\n9. Before them, the people of Noah denied ˹the truth˺ and rejected Our\nservant, calling ˹him˺ insane. And he was intimidated. 10. So he cried out to\nhis Lord, “I am helpless, so help ˹me˺!” 11. So We opened the gates of the\nsky with pouring rain, 12. and caused the earth to burst with springs, so the\nwaters met for a fate already set. 13. We carried him on that ˹Ark made˺ of\nplanks and nails, 14. sailing under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes—a ˹fair˺ punishment\non behalf of the one ˹they˺ denied. 15. We certainly left this[1138] as a sign.\nSo is there anyone who will be mindful? 16. Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My\n\n-- 468 of 694 --\n\npunishment and warnings! 17. And We have certainly made the Quran easy\nto remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful?\nThe People of Hûd\n18. ’Ȃd ˹also˺ rejected ˹the truth˺. Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment\nand warnings! 19. Indeed, We sent against them a furious wind,[1139] on a\nday of unrelenting misery, 20. that snatched people up, leaving them like\ntrunks of uprooted palm trees. 21. Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My\npunishment and warnings! 22. And We have certainly made the Quran easy\nto remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful?\nThe People of\nṢâli\nḥ\n23. Thamûd rejected the warnings ˹as well˺, 24. arguing, “How can we\nfollow one ˹average˺ human being from among us? We would then truly be\nmisguided and insane. 25. Has the revelation been sent down ˹only˺ to him\nout of ˹all of˺ us? In fact, he is a boastful liar.” 26. ˹It was revealed to\nṢâliḥ,˺ “They will soon know who the boastful liar is. 27. We are sending\nthe she-camel as a test for them. So watch them ˹closely˺, and have\npatience. 28. And tell them that the ˹drinking˺ water must be divided\nbetween them ˹and her˺, each taking a turn to drink ˹every other day˺.” 29.\nBut they roused a companion of theirs, so he dared to kill ˹her˺. 30. Then\nhow ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings! 31. Indeed, We sent\nagainst them ˹only˺ one ˹mighty˺ blast, leaving them like the twigs of fence-\nbuilders. 32. And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So\nis there anyone who will be mindful?\nThe People of Lot\n33. The people of Lot ˹also˺ rejected the warnings. 34. We unleashed upon\nthem a storm of stones. As for ˹the believers of˺ Lot’s family, We delivered\nthem before dawn 35. as a blessing from Us. This is how We reward\nwhoever gives thanks. 36. He had already warned them of Our ˹crushing˺\nblow but they disputed the warnings. 37. And they even demanded his\nangel-guests from him,[1140] so We blinded their eyes. ˹And they were told,˺\n“Taste then My punishment and warnings!” 38. And indeed, by the early\nmorning they were overwhelmed by an unrelenting torment. 39. ˹Again\nthey were told,˺ “Taste now My punishment and warnings!” 40. And We\n\n-- 469 of 694 --\n\nhave certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who\nwill be mindful?\nThe People of Pharaoh\n41. And indeed, the warnings ˹also˺ came to the people of Pharaoh. 42.\n˹But˺ they rejected all of Our signs, so We seized them with the ˹crushing˺\ngrip of the Almighty, Most Powerful.\nWarning to Pagan Deniers\n43. Now, are you ˹Meccan˺ disbelievers superior to those ˹destroyed\npeoples˺? Or have you ˹been granted˺ immunity ˹from punishment˺ in divine\nBooks? 44. Or do they say, “We are all ˹a˺ united ˹front˺, bound to prevail.”?\n45. ˹Soon˺ their united front will be defeated and ˹forced to˺ flee.[1141] 46.\nBetter yet, the Hour is their appointed time—and the Hour will be most\ncatastrophic and most bitter. 47. Indeed, the wicked are ˹entrenched˺ in\nmisguidance, and ˹are bound for˺ blazes. 48. On the Day they will be\ndragged into the Fire on their faces, ˹they will be told,˺ “Taste the touch of\nHell!”[1142] 49. Indeed, We have created everything, perfectly preordained.\n50. Our command[1143] is but a single word,[1144] done in the blink of an\neye. 51. We have already destroyed the likes of you. So will any ˹of you˺ be\nmindful? 52. Everything they have done is ˹listed˺ in ˹their˺ records. 53.\nEvery matter, small and large, is written ˹precisely˺.\nReward of the Righteous\n54. Indeed, the righteous will be amid Gardens and rivers,[1145] 55. at the\nSeat of Honour in the presence of the Most Powerful Sovereign.\n***\n\n-- 470 of 694 --\n\n55. The Most Compassionate\n(Ar-Raḥmân)\nThis Meccan sûrah is a call to humans and jinn to acknowledge Allah’s\ninfinite blessings, hence the recurring question: “Then which of your Lord’s\nfavours will you both deny?” which is repeated thirty-one times. Life on\nearth will come to an end, ushering in the Day of Judgment, where people\nwill be classified into three groups based on their deeds and consequent\nrewards: the disbelievers (verses 31-45), the best of the believers (verses\n46-61), and the average believers (verses 62-78).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Favours: 1) Speech\n1. The Most Compassionate 2. taught the Quran, 3. created humanity, 4.\n˹and˺ taught them speech.\nFavour 2) The Universe\n5. The sun and the moon ˹travel˺ with precision. 6. The stars and the trees\nbow down ˹in submission˺.[1146] 7. As for the sky, He raised it ˹high˺, and\nset the balance ˹of justice˺ 8. so that you do not defraud the scales. 9. Weigh\nwith justice, and do not give short measure.\nFavour 3) Provisions\n10. He laid out the earth for all beings. 11. In it are fruit, palm trees with\ndate stalks, 12. and grain with husks, and aromatic plants. 13. Then which\nof your Lord’s favours will you ˹humans and jinn˺ both deny?[1147]\nFavour 4) Humans and Jinn\n14. He created humankind from ˹sounding˺ clay like pottery, 15. and created\njinn from a ˹smokeless˺ flame of fire. 16. Then which of your Lord’s\nfavours will you both deny?\nFavour 5) Natural Marvels\n17. ˹He is˺ Lord of the two easts and the two wests.[1148] 18. Then which of\nyour Lord’s favours will you both deny? 19. He merges the two bodies of\n˹fresh and salt˺ water, 20. yet between them is a barrier they never cross.\n\n-- 471 of 694 --\n\n[1149] 21. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 22. Out of\nboth ˹waters˺ come forth pearls and coral. 23. Then which of your Lord’s\nfavours will you both deny? 24. To Him belong the ships with raised sails,\nsailing through the seas like mountains. 25. Then which of your Lord’s\nfavours will you both deny?\nOnly Allah Is Eternal\n26. Every being on earth is bound to perish. 27. Only your Lord Himself,\n[1150] full of Majesty and Honour, will remain ˹forever˺.[1151] 28. Then\nwhich of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?\nAll Stand In Need of Allah\n29. All those in the heavens and the earth are dependent on Him. Day in and\nday out He has something to bring about.[1152] 30. Then which of your\nLord’s favours will you both deny?\nPunishment of the People of the Left[1153]\n31. We will soon attend to you ˹for judgment˺, O two multitudes ˹of jinn\nand humans˺! 32. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?\n33. O assembly of jinn and humans! If you can penetrate beyond the realms\nof the heavens and the earth, then do so. ˹But˺ you cannot do that without\n˹Our˺ authority. 34. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?\n35. Flames of fire and ˹molten˺ copper will be sent against you, and you\nwill not be able to defend one another. 36. Then which of your Lord’s\nfavours will you both deny? 37. ˹How horrible will it be˺ when the heavens\nwill split apart, becoming rose-red like ˹burnt˺ oil! 38. Then which of your\nLord’s favours will you both deny? 39. On that Day there will be no need\nfor any human or jinn to be asked about their sins.[1154] 40. Then which of\nyour Lord’s favours will you both deny? 41. The wicked will be recognized\nby their appearance, then will be seized by ˹their˺ forelocks and feet. 42.\nThen which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 43. ˹They will be\ntold,˺ “This is the Hell which the wicked denied.” 44. They will alternate\nbetween its flames and scalding water. 45. Then which of your Lord’s\nfavours will you both deny?[1155]\nReward of the Foremost Believers\n46. And whoever is in awe of standing before their Lord will have two\nGardens. 47. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 48.\n\n-- 472 of 694 --\n\n˹Both will be˺ with lush branches. 49. Then which of your Lord’s favours\nwill you both deny? 50. In each ˹Garden˺ will be two flowing springs. 51.\nThen which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 52. In each will be\ntwo types of every fruit. 53. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you\nboth deny? 54. Those ˹believers˺ will recline on furnishings lined with rich\nbrocade. And the fruit of both Gardens will hang within reach. 55. Then\nwhich of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 56. In both ˹Gardens˺ will\nbe maidens of modest gaze, who no human or jinn has ever touched before.\n57. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 58. Those\n˹maidens˺ will be ˹as elegant˺ as rubies and coral. 59. Then which of your\nLord’s favours will you both deny? 60. Is there any reward for goodness\nexcept goodness? 61. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both\ndeny?\nReward of the People of the Right\n62. And below these two ˹Gardens˺ will be two others. 63. Then which of\nyour Lord’s favours will you both deny? 64. Both will be dark green. 65.\nThen which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 66. In each will be\ntwo gushing springs. 67. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both\ndeny? 68. In both will be fruit, palm trees, and pomegranates. 69. Then\nwhich of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 70. In all Gardens will be\nnoble, pleasant mates. 71. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both\ndeny? 72. ˹They will be˺ maidens with gorgeous eyes, reserved in pavilions.\n73. Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 74. No human\nor jinn has ever touched these ˹maidens˺ before.[1156] 75. Then which of\nyour Lord’s favours will you both deny? 76. All ˹believers˺ will be reclining\non green cushions and splendid carpets. 77. Then which of your Lord’s\nfavours will you both deny? 78. Blessed is the Name of your Lord, full of\nMajesty and Honour.\n***\n\n-- 473 of 694 --\n\n56. The Inevitable Event\n(Al-Wâqi’ah)\nThis Meccan sûrah is identical to the previous one in classifying people into\nthree groups on Judgment Day and discussing how Allah’s blessings are\ntaken for granted. These blessings should be seen as a proof of His ability\nto raise the dead for judgment. Moreover, references are made to the\ncreation of the human race, the divine nature of the Quran, and the horrors\nof the apocalypse. Allah is glorified in the last verse of this sûrah and the\nfirst verse of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Three Groups on Judgment Day[1157]\n1. When the Inevitable Event takes place, 2. then no one can deny it has\ncome. 3. It will debase ˹some˺ and elevate ˹others˺.[1158] 4. When the earth\nwill be violently shaken, 5. and the mountains will be crushed to pieces, 6.\nbecoming scattered ˹particles of˺ dust, 7. you will ˹all˺ be ˹divided into˺\nthree groups: 8. the people of the right, how ˹blessed˺ will they be; 9. the\npeople of the left, how ˹miserable˺ will they be; 10. and the foremost ˹in\nfaith˺ will be the foremost ˹in Paradise˺.\n1) The Foremost\n11. They are the ones nearest ˹to Allah˺, 12. in the Gardens of Bliss. 13.\n˹They will be˺ a multitude from earlier generations 14. and a few from later\ngenerations. 15. ˹All will be˺ on jewelled thrones, 16. reclining face to face.\n17. They will be waited on by eternal youths 18. with cups, pitchers, and a\ndrink ˹of pure wine˺ from a flowing stream, 19. that will cause them neither\nheadache nor intoxication. 20. ˹They will also be served˺ any fruit they\nchoose 21. and meat from any bird they desire. 22. And ˹they will have˺\nmaidens with gorgeous eyes, 23. like pristine pearls, 24. ˹all˺ as a reward for\nwhat they used to do. 25. There they will never hear any idle or sinful talk\n— 26. only good and virtuous speech.[1159]\n2) People of the Right\n\n-- 474 of 694 --\n\n27. And the people of the right—how ˹blessed˺ will they be! 28. ˹They will\nbe˺ amid thornless lote trees, 29. clusters of bananas, 30. extended shade,\n31. flowing water, 32. abundant fruit— 33. never out of season nor\nforbidden— 34. and elevated furnishings. 35. Indeed, We will have\nperfectly created their mates, 36. making them virgins, 37. loving and of\nequal age, 38. for the people of the right, 39. ˹who will be˺ a multitude from\nearlier generations 40. and a multitude from later generations.\n3) People of the Left\n41. And the people of the left—how ˹miserable˺ will they be! 42. ˹They will\nbe˺ in scorching heat and boiling water, 43. in the shade of black smoke, 44.\nneither cool nor refreshing. 45. Indeed, before this ˹torment˺ they were\nspoiled by luxury, 46. and persisted in the worst of sin.[1160] 47. They used\nto ask ˹mockingly˺, “When we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will\nwe really be resurrected? 48. And our forefathers as well?” 49. Say, ˹O\nProphet,˺ “Most certainly, earlier and later generations 50. will surely be\ngathered ˹together˺ for the appointed Day. 51. Then you, O misguided\ndeniers, 52. will certainly eat from ˹the fruit of˺ the trees of Zaqqûm,[1161]\n53. filling up ˹your˺ bellies with it. 54. Then on top of that you will drink\nboiling water— 55. and you will drink ˹it˺ like thirsty camels do.” 56. This\nwill be their accommodation on the Day of Judgment.\nAllah’s Power: 1) Creating Humans\n57. It is We Who created you. Will you not then believe ˹in resurrection˺?\n58. Have you considered what you ejaculate? 59. Is it you who create ˹a\nchild out of˺ it, or is it We Who do so? 60. We have ordained death for ˹all\nof˺ you, and We cannot be prevented 61. from transforming and recreating\nyou in forms unknown to you. 62. You already know how you were first\ncreated. Will you not then be mindful?\n2) Causing Plants to Grow\n63. Have you considered what you sow? 64. Is it you who cause it to grow,\nor is it We Who do so? 65. If We willed, We could simply reduce this\n˹harvest˺ to chaff, leaving you to lament, 66. “We have truly suffered a\n˹great˺ loss. 67. In fact, we have been deprived ˹of our livelihood˺.”\n3) Bringing Rain down\n\n-- 475 of 694 --\n\n68. Have you considered the water you drink? 69. Is it you who bring it\ndown from the clouds, or is it We Who do so? 70. If We willed, We could\nmake it salty. Will you not then give thanks?\n4) Producing Fire from Trees\n71. Have you considered the fire you kindle?[1162] 72. Is it you who produce\nits trees, or is it We Who do so? 73. We have made it ˹as˺ a reminder ˹of the\nHellfire˺ and a provision for the travellers. 74. So glorify the Name of your\nLord, the Greatest.\nMessage to Quran Deniers\n75. So I do swear by the positions of the stars— 76. and this, if only you\nknew, is indeed a great oath— 77. that this is truly a noble Quran, 78. in a\nwell-preserved Record,[1163] 79. touched by none except the purified\n˹angels˺.[1164] 80. ˹It is˺ a revelation from the Lord of all worlds. 81. How\ncan you then take this message lightly, 82. and repay ˹Allah for˺ your\nprovisions with denial?[1165]\nA Challenge to Deniers of the Hereafter\n83. Why then ˹are you helpless˺ when the soul ˹of a dying person˺ reaches\n˹their˺ throat, 84. while you are looking on? 85. And We are nearer to such a\nperson than you, but you cannot see. 86. Now, if you are not subject to Our\nWill ˹as you claim˺, 87. bring that soul back, if what you say is true.\nWhich of the Three Will You Be?\n88. So, if the deceased is one of those brought near ˹to Us˺, 89. then ˹such a\nperson will have˺ serenity, fragrance,[1166] and a Garden of Bliss. 90. And if\nthe deceased is one of the people of the right, 91. then ˹they will be told,˺\n“Greetings to you from the people of the right.” 92. But if such person is\none of the misguided deniers, 93. then their accommodation will be boiling\nwater ˹to drink˺ 94. and burning in Hellfire. 95. Indeed, this is the absolute\ntruth. 96. So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Greatest.\n***\n\n-- 476 of 694 --\n\n57. Iron\n(Al-\nḤadîd)\nThis Medinian sûrah, which takes its name from the reference to iron in\nverse 25, is an invitation to strive in Allah’s cause and spend in His Way.\nSimilar to the next sûrah, a strong emphasis is placed on Allah’s knowledge\nand power. It is made clear that Allah is able to revive faith in the hearts of\nthe believers just as He can revive the earth after its death. The believers\nare advised regarding destiny and the life of this world, while the hypocrites\nare warned of the evil fate awaiting them. Some prophets are mentioned\npassingly before making a final invitation to the People of the Book to\nbelieve in Allah and His Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Knowledge and Might\n1. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah, for He is the\nAlmighty, All-Wise. 2. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the\nearth. He gives life and causes death. And He is Most Capable of\neverything. 3. He is the First and the Last, the Most High and Most Near,\n[1167] and He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. 4. He is the One Who\ncreated the heavens and the earth in six Days,[1168] then established Himself\non the Throne. He knows whatever goes into the earth and whatever comes\nout of it, and whatever descends from the sky and whatever ascends into it.\nAnd He is with you wherever you are.[1169] For Allah is All-Seeing of what\nyou do. 5. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And\nto Allah all matters are returned. 6. He merges the night into day and the\nday into night. And He knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.\nBelieve and Support Allah’s Cause\n7. Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and donate from what He has\nentrusted you with. So those of you who believe and donate will have a\nmighty reward.\nWhy Do You Not Believe?\n\n-- 477 of 694 --\n\n8. Why do you not believe in Allah while the Messenger is inviting you to\nhave faith in your Lord, although He has already taken your covenant,[1170]\nif you will ever believe. 9. He is the One Who sends down clear revelations\nto His servant to bring you out of darkness and into light. For indeed Allah\nis Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to you.\nWhy Do You Not Donate?\n10. And why should you not spend in the cause of Allah, while Allah is the\n˹sole˺ inheritor of the heavens and the earth? Those of you who donated and\nfought before the victory ˹over Mecca˺ are unparalleled. They are far\ngreater in rank than those who donated and fought afterwards.[1171] Yet\nAllah has promised each a fine reward. And Allah is All-Aware of what you\ndo.\nA Generous Reward for the Generous\n11. Who is it that will lend to Allah a good loan which Allah will multiply\n˹many times over˺ for them, and they will have an honourable reward?[1172]\n12. On that Day you will see believing men and women with their light\nshining ahead of them and on their right. ˹They will be told,˺ “Today you\nhave good news of Gardens, under which rivers flow, ˹for you˺ to stay in\nforever. This is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.”\nThe Hypocrites Entrenched in Darkness\n13. On that Day hypocrite men and women will beg the believers, “Wait for\nus so that we may have some of your light.” It will be said ˹mockingly˺,\n“Go back ˹to the world˺ and seek a light ˹there˺!” Then a ˹separating˺ wall\nwith a gate will be erected between them. On the near side will be grace and\non the far side will be torment.[1173] 14. The tormented will cry out to those\ngraced, “Were we not with you?” They will reply, “Yes ˹you were˺. But you\nchose to be tempted ˹by hypocrisy˺, ˹eagerly˺ awaited ˹our demise˺, doubted\n˹the truth˺, and were deluded by false hopes until Allah’s decree ˹of your\ndeath˺ came to pass. And ˹so˺ the Chief Deceiver[1174] deceived you about\nAllah. 15. So Today no ransom will be accepted from you ˹hypocrites˺, nor\nfrom the disbelievers. Your home is the Fire—it is the ˹only˺ fitting place\nfor you. What an evil destination!”\nHardened Hearts\n\n-- 478 of 694 --\n\n16. Has the time not yet come for believers’ hearts to be humbled at the\nremembrance of Allah and what has been revealed of the truth, and not be\nlike those given the Scripture before—˹those˺ who were spoiled for so long\nthat their hearts became hardened. And many of them are ˹still˺ rebellious.\n17. Know that Allah revives the earth after its death.[1175] We have certainly\nmade the signs clear for you so perhaps you will understand.\nReward of the Faithful\n18. Indeed, those men and women who give in charity and lend to Allah a\ngood loan will have it multiplied for them, and they will have an\nhonourable reward.[1176] 19. ˹As for˺ those who believe in Allah and His\nmessengers, it is they who are ˹truly˺ the people of truth. And the martyrs,\nwith their Lord, will have their reward and their light. But ˹as for˺ those\nwho disbelieve and reject Our signs, it is they who will be the residents of\nthe Hellfire.\nFleeting Life vs. Eternal Life\n20. Know that this worldly life is no more than play, amusement, luxury,\nmutual boasting, and competition in wealth and children. This is like rain\nthat causes plants to grow, to the delight of the planters. But later the plants\ndry up and you see them wither, then they are reduced to chaff. And in the\nHereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness and pleasure\nof Allah, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of\nenjoyment. 21. ˹So˺ compete with one another for forgiveness from your\nLord and a Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those\nwho believe in Allah and His messengers. This is the favour of Allah. He\ngrants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.\nEverything Is Destined\n22. No calamity ˹or blessing˺ occurs on earth or in yourselves without being\n˹written˺ in a Record before We bring it into being. This is certainly easy for\nAllah. 23. ˹We let you know this˺ so that you neither grieve over what you\nhave missed nor boast over what He has granted you. For Allah does not\nlike whoever is arrogant, boastful— 24. those who are stingy and promote\nstinginess among people. And whoever turns away ˹should know that˺\nAllah ˹alone˺ is truly the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.\nProphets and Justice\n\n-- 479 of 694 --\n\n25. Indeed, We sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and with them We\nsent down the Scripture and the balance ˹of justice˺ so that people may\nadminister justice. And We sent down iron with its great might, benefits for\nhumanity, and means for Allah to prove who ˹is willing to˺ stand up for Him\nand His messengers without seeing Him. Surely Allah is All-Powerful,\nAlmighty.\nNoah and Abraham\n26. And indeed, We sent Noah and Abraham and reserved prophethood and\nrevelation for their descendants. Some of them are ˹rightly˺ guided, while\nmost are rebellious.\nJesus and His Followers\n27. Then in the footsteps of these ˹prophets˺, We sent Our messengers, and\n˹after them˺ We sent Jesus, son of Mary, and granted him the Gospel, and\ninstilled compassion and mercy into the hearts of his followers. As for\nmonasticism, they made it up—We never ordained it for them—only\nseeking to please Allah, yet they did not ˹even˺ observe it strictly. So We\nrewarded those of them who were faithful. But most of them are rebellious.\nAn Appeal to Jews and Christians\n28. O people of faith! Fear Allah and believe in His Messenger. ˹And˺ He\nwill grant you a double share of His mercy, provide you with a light to walk\nin ˹on Judgment Day˺, and forgive you. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most\nMerciful. 29. ˹This is so˺ that the People of the Book ˹who deny the\nProphet˺ may know that they do not have any control over Allah’s grace,\nand that all grace is in Allah’s Hands. He grants it to whoever He wills. For\nAllah is the Lord of infinite bounty.\n***\n\n-- 480 of 694 --\n\n58. The Pleading Woman\n(Al-Mujâdilah)\nA companion named Khawlah bint Tha’labah had a disagreement with her\nhusband, Aws ibn A\nṣ-\nṢâmit, who then told her that she was as unlawful for\nhim as the\nẓahr (back) of his mother. This statement had been considered to\nbe a form of divorce (known as\nẓihâr) in Arabia. Khawlah came to the\nProphet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to ask for his opinion. He (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) told her that he had\nnot received any revelation in this regard, and that, based on tradition, she\nwas divorced. She argued that she and her husband had children together\nwho would suffer if their parents were separated. Then she started to plead\nto Allah as the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) repeated the same answer. Eventually, this\nMedinian sûrah was revealed in response to her pleas, thereby abolishing\nthis ancient practice. The sûrah emphasizes Allah’s infinite knowledge and\noverwhelming power, and makes it clear that those who ally themselves\nwith Allah and comply with His orders are bound to prevail, whereas those\nwho challenge Him and ally themselves with His enemies will be debased\nand vanquished. This concept is elaborated upon in the next sûrah (verses\n59:1-4 and 11-17).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Case of Khawlah\n1. Indeed, Allah has heard the argument of the woman who pleaded with\nyou ˹O Prophet˺ concerning her husband, and appealed to Allah. Allah has\nheard your exchange. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.\nThe Ruling on\nẒihâr\n2. Those of you who ˹sinfully˺ divorce their wives by comparing them to\ntheir mothers ˹should know that˺ their wives are in no way their mothers.\nNone can be their mothers except those who gave birth to them. What they\nsay is certainly detestable and false. Yet Allah is truly Ever-Pardoning, All-\nForgiving. 3. Those who divorce their wives in this manner, then ˹wish to˺\nretract what they said, must free a slave before they touch each other. This\n˹penalty˺ is meant to deter you. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. 4.\n\n-- 481 of 694 --\n\nBut if the husband cannot afford this, let him then fast two consecutive\nmonths before the couple touch each other. But if he is unable ˹to fast˺, then\nlet him feed sixty poor people. This is to re-affirm your faith in Allah and\nHis Messenger. These are the limits set by Allah. And the disbelievers will\nsuffer a painful punishment.\nFate of the Defiant\n5. Indeed, those who defy Allah and His Messenger will be debased, just\nlike those before them. We have certainly sent down clear revelations. And\nthe disbelievers will suffer a humiliating punishment. 6. On the Day Allah\nresurrects them all together, He will then inform them of what they have\ndone. Allah has kept account of it all, while they have forgotten it. For\nAllah is a Witness over all things.\nAllah’s Infinite Knowledge\n7. Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever\nis on the earth? If three converse privately, He is their fourth. If five, He is\ntheir sixth. Whether fewer or more, He is with them[1177] wherever they\nmay be. Then, on the Day of Judgment, He will inform them of what they\nhave done. Surely Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.\nEvil, Secret Talks\n8. Have you not seen those who were forbidden from secret talks, yet they\n˹always˺ return to what they were forbidden from, conspiring in sin,\naggression, and disobedience to the Messenger? And when they come to\nyou ˹O Prophet˺, they greet you not as Allah greets you,[1178] and say to one\nanother, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough\nfor them—they will burn in it. And what an evil destination!\nGuidelines for Secret Talks\n9. O believers! When you converse privately, let it not be for sin,\naggression, or disobedience to the Messenger, but let it be for goodness and\nrighteousness. And fear Allah, to Whom you will ˹all˺ be gathered. 10.\nSecret talks are only inspired by Satan to grieve the believers. Yet he cannot\nharm them whatsoever except by Allah’s Will. So in Allah let the believers\nput their trust.\nEtiquette of Gatherings\n\n-- 482 of 694 --\n\n11. O believers! When you are told to make room in gatherings, then do so.\nAllah will make room for you ˹in His grace˺. And if you are told to rise,\nthen do so. Allah will elevate those of you who are faithful, and ˹raise˺\nthose gifted with knowledge in rank. And Allah is All-Aware of what you\ndo.\nCharity Before Consulting the Prophet[1179]\n12. O believers! When you consult the Messenger privately, give something\nin charity before your consultation. That is better and purer for you. But if\nyou lack the means, then Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 13.\nAre you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultations\n˹with him˺? Since you are unable to do so, and Allah has turned to you in\nmercy, then ˹continue to˺ establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and\nHis Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.\nSatan’s Party\n14. Have you not seen those ˹hypocrites˺ who ally themselves with a people\nwith whom Allah is displeased? They are neither with you nor with them.\nAnd they swear to lies knowingly. 15. Allah has prepared for them a severe\npunishment. Evil indeed is what they do. 16. They have made their ˹false˺\noaths as a shield, hindering ˹others˺ from the cause of Allah. So they will\nsuffer a humiliating punishment. 17. Neither their wealth nor children will\nbe of any help to them against Allah whatsoever. It is they who will be the\nresidents of the Fire. They will be there forever. 18. On the Day Allah\nresurrects them all, they will ˹falsely˺ swear to Him as they swear to you,\nthinking they have something to stand on. Indeed, it is they who are the\n˹total˺ liars. 19. Satan has taken hold of them, causing them to forget the\nremembrance of Allah. They are the party of Satan. Surely Satan’s party is\nbound to lose.\nAllah’s Party\n20. ˹As for˺ those who defy Allah and His Messenger, they will definitely\nbe among the most debased. 21. Allah has decreed, “I and My messengers\nwill certainly prevail.” Surely Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty. 22. You will\nnever find a people who ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day loyal to\nthose who defy Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their parents,\nchildren, siblings, or extended family. For those ˹believers˺, Allah has\ninstilled faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Him.\n\n-- 483 of 694 --\n\n[1180] He will admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there\nforever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are\nthe party of Allah. Indeed, Allah’s party is bound to succeed.\n***\n\n-- 484 of 694 --\n\n59. The Banishment\n(Al-\nḤashr)\nThis Medinian sûrah takes its name from verse 2, which refers to the exile\nof the Jewish tribe of Banu An-Na\nḍîr from Medina for conspiring with the\nMeccan pagans to violate peace agreements with the Muslims. The\nhypocrites are condemned for their secret alliance with Banu An-Na\nḍîr.\nSome instructions are given regarding the distribution of the spoils of war.\nThe sûrah closes by stressing unwavering obedience to Almighty Allah,\nwhich is further emphasized at the beginning of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nBanu An-Na\nḍîr Exiled\n1. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth glorifies Allah.\nFor He is the Almighty, All-Wise. 2. He is the One Who expelled the\ndisbelievers of the People of the Book from their homes for ˹their˺ first\nbanishment ˹ever˺. You never thought they would go. And they thought\ntheir strongholds would put them out of Allah’s reach. But ˹the decree of˺\nAllah came upon them from where they never expected. And He cast horror\ninto their hearts so they destroyed their houses with their own hands and the\nhands of the believers.[1181] So take a lesson ˹from this˺, O people of\ninsight! 3. Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would have certainly\npunished them in this world. And in the Hereafter they will suffer the\npunishment of the Fire. 4. This is because they defied Allah and His\nMessenger. And whoever defies Allah, then Allah is truly severe in\npunishment.\nRuling on Palm Trees and Gains\n5. Whatever palm trees you ˹believers˺ cut down or left standing intact, it\nwas ˹all˺ by Allah’s Will, so that He might disgrace the rebellious.[ 11 8 2 ] 6.\nAs for the gains Allah has turned over to His Messenger from them—you\ndid not ˹even˺ spur on any horse or camel for such gains. But Allah gives\nauthority to His messengers over whoever He wills. For Allah is Most\nCapable of everything.\n\n-- 485 of 694 --\n\nDistribution of Future Gains[1183]\n7. As for gains granted by Allah to His Messenger from the people of\n˹other˺ lands, they are for Allah and the Messenger, his close relatives,\norphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers so that wealth may not merely\ncirculate among your rich. Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it. And\nwhatever he forbids you from, leave it. And fear Allah. Surely Allah is\nsevere in punishment. 8. ˹Some of the gains will be˺ for poor emigrants who\nwere driven out of their homes and wealth, seeking Allah’s bounty and\npleasure, and standing up for Allah and His Messenger. They are the ones\ntrue in faith.\nExcellence of the People of Medina[1184]\n9. As for those who had settled in the city and ˹embraced˺ the faith before\n˹the arrival of˺ the emigrants, they love whoever immigrates to them, never\nhaving a desire in their hearts for whatever ˹of the gains˺ is given to the\nemigrants. They give ˹the emigrants˺ preference over themselves even\nthough they may be in need. And whoever is saved from the selfishness of\ntheir own souls, it is they who are ˹truly˺ successful.\nLater Believers\n10. And those who come after them will pray, “Our Lord! Forgive us and\nour fellow believers who preceded us in faith, and do not allow bitterness\ninto our hearts towards those who believe. Our Lord! Indeed, You are Ever\nGracious, Most Merciful.”\nThe Hypocrites and Banu An-Na\nḍîr\n11. Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen the hypocrites who say to their fellow\ndisbelievers from the People of the Book,[1185] “If you are expelled, we will\ncertainly leave with you, and We will never obey anyone against you. And\nif you are fought against, we will surely help you.”? But Allah bears\nwitness that they are truly liars. 12. Indeed, if they are expelled, the\nhypocrites will never leave with them. And if they are fought against, the\nhypocrites will never help them. And even if the hypocrites did so, they\nwould certainly flee, then the disbelievers would be left with no help.\nCowardice of Both Groups\n13. Indeed, there is more fear in their hearts for you ˹believers˺ than for\nAllah. That is because they are a people who do not comprehend. 14. Even\n\n-- 486 of 694 --\n\nunited, they would not ˹dare˺ fight against you except ˹from˺ within fortified\nstrongholds or from behind walls. Their malice for each other is intense:\nyou think they are united, yet their hearts are divided. That is because they\nare a people with no ˹real˺ understanding. 15. They are ˹both just˺ like those\nwho recently went down before them:[1186] they tasted the evil\nconsequences of their doings. And they will suffer a painful punishment.\nThe Hypocrites Luring the Disbelievers\n16. ˹They are˺ like Satan when he lures someone to disbelieve. Then after\nthey have done so, he will say ˹on Judgment Day˺, “I have absolutely\nnothing to do with you. I truly fear Allah—the Lord of all worlds.”[1187] 17.\nSo they will both end up in the Fire, staying there forever. That is the\nreward of the wrongdoers.\nJudge Yourselves Before Judgment Day\n18. O believers! Be mindful of Allah and let every soul look to what ˹deeds˺\nit has sent forth for tomorrow.[1188] And fear Allah, ˹for˺ certainly Allah is\nAll-Aware of what you do. 19. And do not be like those who forgot Allah,\nso He made them forget themselves. It is they who are ˹truly˺ rebellious. 20.\nThe residents of the Fire cannot be equal to the residents of Paradise. ˹Only˺\nthe residents of Paradise will be successful.\nImpact of the Quran\n21. Had We sent down this Quran upon a mountain, you would have\ncertainly seen it humbled and torn apart in awe of Allah. We set forth such\ncomparisons for people, ˹so˺ perhaps they may reflect.[1189]\nAllah’s Beautiful Names\n22. He is Allah—there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him: Knower\nof the seen and unseen. He is the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful. 23.\nHe is Allah—there is no god except Him: the King, the Most Holy, the All-\nPerfect, the Source of Serenity, the Watcher ˹of all˺, the Almighty, the\nSupreme in Might,[1190] the Majestic. Glorified is Allah far above what they\nassociate with Him ˹in worship˺! 24. He is Allah: the Creator, the Inventor,\nthe Shaper. He ˹alone˺ has the Most Beautiful Names. Whatever is in the\nheavens and the earth ˹constantly˺ glorifies Him. And He is the Almighty,\nAll-Wise.\n***\n\n-- 487 of 694 --\n\n60. The Test of Faith\n(Al-Mumta\nḥanah)\nThis Medinian sûrah was revealed prior to the Prophet’s conquest of Mecca\nfollowing the pagans’ violation of the peace treaty they had signed with the\nMuslims at\t\nḤudaibiyah. Despite the Prophet’s orders to keep this plan\nsecret, a companion by the name of\nḤâṭib ibn Abi Balta’ah sent a warning\nletter to the Meccans, hoping that in turn they would protect his family—\nwho were still in Mecca—in case the Muslims failed to enter the city. Soon\nthe Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received a revelation about what\nḤâṭib did. The letter\nwas intercepted, and\t\nḤâṭib was later forgiven. Mecca surrendered\npeacefully to the Muslims, and its residents were pardoned by the Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Muslims are instructed to be loyal to Allah and fellow believers,\nfollowing the example of Prophet Abraham (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) (verses 4-6). The\nbelievers are not forbidden from courtesy to non-Muslims as long as they\nare not persecuting Muslims (verses 8-9). This sûrah takes its name from\ntesting the faith of women fleeing Mecca by asking them, for example, if\nthey have emigrated for Islam or only to be separated from their pagan\nhusbands (verse 10). Other instructions to the believers are given at the end\nof this sûrah and the beginning of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllying with the Enemy\n1. O believers! Do not take My enemies and yours as trusted allies, showing\nthem affection even though they deny what has come to you of the truth.\nThey drove the Messenger and yourselves out ˹of Mecca˺, simply for your\nbelief in Allah, your Lord. If you ˹truly˺ emigrated[1191] to struggle in My\ncause and seek My pleasure, ˹then do not take them as allies,˺ disclosing\nsecrets ˹of the believers˺ to the pagans out of affection for them, when I\nknow best whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal. And whoever of\nyou does this has truly strayed from the Right Way. 2. If they gain the upper\nhand over you, they would be your ˹open˺ enemies, unleashing their hands\nand tongues to harm you, and wishing that you would abandon faith. 3.\n\n-- 488 of 694 --\n\nNeither your relatives nor children will benefit you on Judgment Day—He\nwill decide between you ˹all˺. For Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.\nThe Example of Abraham and His Followers\n4. You already have an excellent example in Abraham and those with him,\nwhen they said to their people, “We totally dissociate ourselves from you\nand ˹shun˺ whatever ˹idols˺ you worship besides Allah. We reject you. The\nenmity and hatred that has arisen between us and you will last until you\nbelieve in Allah alone.” The only exception is when Abraham said to his\nfather, “I will seek forgiveness for you,˹” adding, “but˺ I cannot protect you\nfrom Allah at all.” ˹The believers prayed,˺ “Our Lord! In You we trust. And\nto You we ˹always˺ turn. And to You is the final return. 5. Our Lord! Do not\nsubject us to the persecution of the disbelievers. Forgive us, our Lord! You\n˹alone˺ are truly the Almighty, All-Wise.” 6. You certainly have an excellent\nexample in them for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day. But\nwhoever turns away, then surely Allah ˹alone˺ is the Self-Sufficient,\nPraiseworthy.\nYesterday’s Enemies, Tomorrow’s Friends\n7. ˹In time,˺ Allah may bring about goodwill between you and those of them\nyou ˹now˺ hold as enemies. For Allah is Most Capable. And Allah is All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\nKindness to Non-Muslims\n8. Allah does not forbid you from dealing kindly and fairly with those who\nhave neither fought nor driven you out of your homes. Surely Allah loves\nthose who are fair. 9. Allah only forbids you from befriending those who\nhave fought you for ˹your˺ faith, driven you out of your homes, or\nsupported ˹others˺ in doing so. And whoever takes them as friends, then it is\nthey who are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.\nMarriage of Female Emigrants\n10. O believers! When the believing women come to you as emigrants,[1192]\ntest their intentions—their faith is best known to Allah—and if you find\nthem to be believers, then do not send them back to the disbelievers. These\n˹women˺ are not lawful ˹wives˺ for the disbelievers, nor are the disbelievers\nlawful ˹husbands˺ for them. ˹But˺ repay the disbelievers whatever ˹dowries˺\nthey had paid. And there is no blame on you if you marry these ˹women˺ as\n\n-- 489 of 694 --\n\nlong as you pay them their dowries. And do not hold on to marriage with\npolytheistic women.[1193] ˹But˺ demand ˹repayment of˺ whatever ˹dowries˺\nyou had paid, and let the disbelievers do the same. That is the judgment of\nAllah—He judges between you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nWhen Dowry Is Not Repaid to Muslims\n11. And if any of your wives desert you to the disbelievers, and later you\ntake spoils from them, then pay those whose wives have gone, the\nequivalent of whatever ˹dowry˺ they had paid. And be mindful of Allah, in\nWhom you believe.\nWomen Pledge Allegiance\n12. O Prophet! When the believing women come to you, pledging to you\nthat they will neither associate anything with Allah ˹in worship˺, nor steal,\nnor fornicate, nor kill their children, nor falsely attribute ˹illegitimate˺\nchildren to their husbands,[1194] nor disobey you in what is right, then\naccept their pledge, and ask Allah to forgive them. Surely Allah is All-\nForgiving, Most Merciful.\nDo Not Ally with the Enemy\n13. O believers! Do not ally yourselves with a people Allah is displeased\nwith. They already have no hope for the Hereafter, just like the disbelievers\nlying in ˹their˺ graves.\n***\n\n-- 490 of 694 --\n\n61. The ˹Solid˺ Ranks\n(Aṣ-\nṢaff)\nThe believers are instructed to strive in Allah’s cause in solid battle\nformations (verse 4), hence the name of this Medinian sûrah. The disciples\nof Jesus, who stood up for Allah, are cited as an example for the believers\nto emulate. The believers are reassured that the truth will prevail despite\nthe disbelievers’ unrelenting plots against it. Those who stand up for Allah\nare promised great rewards in both worlds. The next sûrah provides more\ninstructions to the believers.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah Is Glorified by All\n1. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth glorifies Allah.\nFor He ˹alone˺ is the Almighty, All-Wise.\nDo What You Say[1195]\n2. O believers! Why do you say what you do not do? 3. How despicable it is\nin the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do! 4. Surely Allah loves\nthose who fight in His cause in ˹solid˺ ranks as if they were one concrete\nstructure.\nMoses and His People\n5. ˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people!\nWhy do you hurt me when you already know I am Allah’s messenger to\nyou?” So when they ˹persistently˺ deviated, Allah caused their hearts to\ndeviate. For Allah does not guide the rebellious people.\nJesus and the Israelites\n6. And ˹remember˺ when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O children of Israel! I\nam truly Allah’s messenger to you, confirming the Torah which came\nbefore me, and giving good news of a messenger after me whose name will\nbe Aḥmad.”[1196] Yet when the Prophet came to them with clear proofs,\nthey said, “This is pure magic.”\nRejecting Islam\n\n-- 491 of 694 --\n\n7. Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies about Allah when\ninvited to submit ˹to Him˺?[1197] For Allah does not guide the wrongdoing\npeople. 8. They wish to extinguish Allah’s light with their mouths, but\nAllah will ˹certainly˺ perfect His light, even to the dismay of the\ndisbelievers. 9. He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with ˹true˺\nguidance and the religion of truth, making it prevail over all others, even to\nthe dismay of the polytheists.\nA Profitable Bargain\n10. O believers! Shall I guide you to an exchange that will save you from a\npainful punishment? 11. ˹It is to˺ have faith in Allah and His Messenger,\nand strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best\nfor you, if only you knew. 12. He will forgive your sins, and admit you into\nGardens under which rivers flow, and ˹house you in˺ splendid homes in the\nGardens of Eternity. That is the ultimate triumph. 13. ˹He will also give\nyou˺ another favour that you long for: help from Allah and an imminent\nvictory. ˹So˺ give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the believers.\nJesus and the Disciples\n14. O believers! Stand up for Allah, as Jesus, son of Mary, asked the\ndisciples, “Who will stand up with me for Allah?” The disciples replied,\n“We will stand up for Allah.” Then a group from the Children of Israel\nbelieved while another disbelieved. We then supported the believers against\ntheir enemies, so they prevailed.\n***\n\n-- 492 of 694 --\n\n62. Friday Congregation\n(Al-Jumu’ah)\nThis sûrah and the previous one have much in common. Both start by\npraising Allah. Those among the Jews who harmed Moses (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص),\naccording to the previous sûrah (61:5), are criticized here for not upholding\nthe Torah (verse 5). Since the disciples of Jesus (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) are commended in\nthe previous sûrah (61:14), the companions of Mu\nḥammad (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) are\nhonoured in this sûrah (verses 2-4). The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is foretold by\nJesus (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the previous sûrah (61:6) and is presented in this sûrah as\nAllah’s favour to the believers. Similar to the previous sûrah, some\ninstructions are given to the believers—this time, regarding the Friday\ncongregation (verse 9), which gives this Medinian sûrah its name.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Favour to the Believers\n1. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth ˹constantly˺\nglorifies Allah—the King, the Most Holy, the Almighty, the All-Wise. 2. He\nis the One Who raised for the illiterate ˹people˺ a messenger from among\nthemselves—reciting to them His revelations, purifying them, and teaching\nthem the Book and wisdom, for indeed they had previously been clearly\nastray— 3. along with others of them who have not yet joined them ˹in\nfaith˺. For He is the Almighty, All-Wise. 4. This is the favour of Allah. He\ngrants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.\nUnutilized Knowledge[1198]\n5. The example of those who were entrusted with ˹observing˺ the Torah but\nfailed to do so, is that of a donkey carrying books.[1199] How evil is the\nexample of those who reject Allah’s signs! For Allah does not guide the\nwrongdoing people.\nChallenge to the Israelites\n6. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O Jews! If you claim to be Allah’s chosen ˹people˺ out\nof all humanity, then wish for death, if what you say is true.” 7. But they\nwill never wish for that because of what their hands have done.[1200] And\n\n-- 493 of 694 --\n\nAllah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers. 8. Say, “The death you\nare running away from will inevitably come to you. Then you will be\nreturned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, and He will inform you of\nwhat you used to do.”\nAttending Friday Congregation\n9. O believers! When the call to prayer is made on Friday, then proceed\n˹diligently˺ to the remembrance of Allah and leave off ˹your˺ business. That\nis best for you, if only you knew. 10. Once the prayer is over, disperse\nthroughout the land and seek the bounty of Allah. And remember Allah\noften so you may be successful.\nLeaving the Sermon[1201]\n11. When they saw the fanfare along with the caravan, they ˹almost all˺\nflocked to it, leaving you ˹O Prophet˺ standing ˹on the pulpit˺. Say, “What is\nwith Allah is far better than amusement and merchandise. And Allah is the\nBest Provider.”\n***\n\n-- 494 of 694 --\n\n63. The Hypocrites\n(Al-Munâfiqûn)\nSimilar to the two previous sûrahs, this Medinian sûrah closes by offering\nmore advice to the believers. The hypocrites are rebuked for hindering\nothers from the path of Allah and discouraging people from donating in His\ncause. In contrast, the believers are advised to donate before they are\novertaken by death—a reality that can come at any time.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Hypocrites Have No Faith\n1. When the hypocrites come to you ˹O Prophet˺, they say, “We bear\nwitness that you are certainly the Messenger of Allah”—and surely Allah\nknows that you are His Messenger—but Allah bears witness that the\nhypocrites are truly liars. 2. They have made their ˹false˺ oaths as a shield,\nhindering ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah. Evil indeed is what they do! 3.\nThis is because they believed and then abandoned faith. Therefore, their\nhearts have been sealed, so they do not comprehend.\nAll That Glitters Is Not Gold\n4. When you see them, their appearance impresses you. And when they\nspeak, you listen to their ˹impressive˺ speech. But they are ˹just˺ like\n˹worthless˺ planks of wood leaned ˹against a wall˺. They think every cry is\nagainst them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah condemn\nthem! How can they be deluded ˹from the truth˺?\nHypocrites’ Unwillingness to Repent[1202]\n5. When it is said to them, “Come! The Messenger of Allah will pray for\nyou to be forgiven,” they turn their heads ˹in disgust˺, and you see them ˹O\nProphet˺ turn away in arrogance. 6. It is the same whether you pray for their\nforgiveness or not, Allah will not forgive them. Surely Allah does not guide\nthe rebellious people.\nHypocrites’ Contempt for the Believers\n7. They are the ones who say ˹to one another˺, “Do not spend ˹anything˺ on\nthose ˹emigrants˺ with the Messenger of Allah so that they will break away\n\n-- 495 of 694 --\n\n˹from him˺.” But to Allah ˹alone˺ belong the treasuries of the heavens and\nthe earth, yet the hypocrites do not comprehend. 8. They say, “If we return\nto Medina, the honourable will definitely expel the inferior.” But all honour\nand power belongs to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, yet the\nhypocrites do not know.\nBe Faithful and Charitable\n9. O believers! Do not let your wealth or your children divert you from the\nremembrance of Allah. For whoever does so, it is they who are the ˹true˺\nlosers. 10. And donate from what We have provided for you before death\ncomes to one of you, and you cry, “My Lord! If only You delayed me for a\nshort while, I would give in charity and be one of the righteous.” 11. But\nAllah never delays a soul when its appointed time comes. And Allah is All-\nAware of what you do.\n***\n\n-- 496 of 694 --\n\n64. Mutual Loss and Gain\n(At-Taghâbun)\nThis Medinian sûrah takes its name from the reference to the Day of\nJudgment in verse 9, where people are divided into winners and losers.\nSince the last sûrah closes by urging the believers to donate before they are\novertaken by death, this sûrah opens by emphasizing Allah’s power to\ncreate and His ability to bring the dead back to life for judgment. The sûrah\nconcludes by bidding the believers to spend in the cause of Allah, and not\nbe discouraged by concerns for their spouses and children. The rights of\nspouses and children after divorce are laid out in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Infinite Power and Knowledge\n1. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth ˹constantly˺\nglorifies Allah. The kingdom is His, and all praise is for Him. For He is\nMost Capable of everything. 2. He is the One Who created you, yet some of\nyou are disbelievers while some are believers. And Allah is All-Seeing of\nwhat you do. 3. He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. He\nshaped you ˹in the womb˺, perfecting your form. And to Him is the final\nreturn. 4. He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And He\nknows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal. For Allah knows\nbest what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.\nEarlier Deniers\n5. Have the stories of those who disbelieved before not reached you\n˹pagans˺? They tasted the evil consequences of their doings, and they will\nsuffer a painful punishment. 6. That was because their messengers used to\ncome to them with clear proofs, but they said ˹mockingly˺, “How can\nhumans be our guides?” So they persisted in disbelief and turned away. And\nAllah was not in need ˹of their faith˺. For Allah is Self-Sufficient,\nPraiseworthy.\nA Message to Present Deniers\n\n-- 497 of 694 --\n\n7. The disbelievers claim they will not be resurrected. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺\n“Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected, then you will certainly be\ninformed of what you have done. And that is easy for Allah.” 8. So believe\nin Allah and His Messenger and in the Light[1203] We have revealed. And\nAllah is All-Aware of what you do. 9. ˹Consider˺ the Day He will gather\nyou ˹all˺ for the Day of Gathering—that will be the Day of mutual loss and\ngain. So whoever believes in Allah and does good, He will absolve them of\ntheir sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay\nthere for ever and ever. That is the ultimate triumph. 10. As for those who\ndisbelieve and reject Our revelations, they will be the residents of the Fire,\nstaying there forever. What an evil destination!\nReassuring the Believers\n11. No calamity befalls ˹anyone˺ except by Allah’s Will. And whoever has\nfaith in Allah, He will ˹rightly˺ guide their hearts ˹through adversity˺. And\nAllah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. 12. Obey Allah and obey the\nMessenger! But if you turn away, then Our Messenger’s duty is only to\ndeliver ˹the message˺ clearly. 13. Allah—there is no god ˹worthy of\nworship˺ except Him. So in Allah let the believers put their trust.\nThe Test of Family and Wealth\n14. O believers! Indeed, some of your spouses and children are enemies to\nyou,[1204] so beware of them. But if you pardon, overlook, and forgive ˹their\nfaults˺, then Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 15. Your wealth\nand children are only a test, but Allah ˹alone˺ has a great reward. 16. So be\nmindful of Allah to the best of your ability, hear and obey, and spend in\ncharity—that will be best for you. And whoever is saved from the\nselfishness of their own souls, it is they who are ˹truly˺ successful. 17. If\nyou lend to Allah a good loan, He will multiply it for you and forgive you.\nFor Allah is Most Appreciative, Most Forbearing. 18. ˹He is the˺ Knower of\nthe seen and unseen—the Almighty, All-Wise.\n***\n\n-- 498 of 694 --\n\n65. Divorce\n(Aṭ-\nṬalâq)\nThis Medinian sûrah outlines the manner of divorce and accommodation of\ndivorced women and their young children (verses 1-7). Those who comply\nwith Allah’s commands are promised a great reward, whereas those who\ndefy Him are warned of the fate of those who were destroyed before.\nComplying with Allah’s orders is elaborated upon in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nProper Divorce\n1. O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ When you ˹intend to˺ divorce women,\nthen divorce them with concern for their waiting period,[1205] and count it\naccurately. And fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their homes\n˹during the waiting period˺, nor should they leave—unless they commit a\nblatant misconduct. These are the limits set by Allah. And whoever\ntransgresses Allah’s limits has truly wronged his own soul. You never know,\nperhaps Allah will bring about a change ˹of heart˺ later.[1206]\nDivorced Women After the Waiting Period\n2. Then when they have ˹almost˺ reached the end of their waiting period,\neither retain them honourably or separate from them honourably.[1207] And\ncall two of your reliable men to witness ˹either way˺—and ˹let the\nwitnesses˺ bear true testimony for ˹the sake of˺ Allah. This is enjoined on\nwhoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever is mindful of\nAllah, He will make a way out for them, 3. and provide for them from\nsources they could never imagine. And whoever puts their trust in Allah,\nthen He ˹alone˺ is sufficient for them. Certainly Allah achieves His Will.\nAllah has already set a destiny for everything.\nWaiting Periods for Divorced Women\n4. As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not\nknow, their waiting period is three months, and those who have not\nmenstruated as well. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period\nends with delivery.[1208] And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make\n\n-- 499 of 694 --\n\ntheir matters easy for them. 5. This is the commandment of Allah, which He\nhas revealed to you. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will absolve\nthem of their sins and reward them immensely.\nHousing for Divorced Women\n6. Let them live where you live ˹during their waiting period˺, according to\nyour means. And do not harass them to make their stay unbearable. If they\nare pregnant, then maintain them until they deliver. And if they nurse your\nchild,[1209] compensate them, and consult together courteously. But if you\nfail to reach an agreement, then another woman will nurse ˹the child˺ for the\nfather. 7. Let the man of wealth provide according to his means. As for the\none with limited resources, let him provide according to whatever Allah has\ngiven him. Allah does not require of any soul beyond what He has given it.\nAfter hardship, Allah will bring about ease.\nAn Invitation to True Faith\n8. ˹Imagine˺ how many societies rebelled against the commandments of\ntheir Lord and His messengers, so We called each ˹society˺ to a severe\naccount and subjected them to a horrible punishment. 9. So they tasted the\nevil consequences of their doings, and the outcome of their doings was\n˹total˺ loss. 10. Allah has ˹also˺ prepared for them a severe punishment. So\nfear Allah, O people of reason and faith. Allah has indeed revealed to you a\nReminder,[1210] 11. ˹and sent˺ a messenger reciting to you Allah’s\nrevelations, making things clear so that He may bring those who believe\nand do good out of darkness and into light. And whoever believes in Allah\nand does good will be admitted by Him into Gardens under which rivers\nflow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah will have indeed granted them an\nexcellent provision.\nAllah’s Infinite Power and Knowledge\n12. Allah is the One Who created seven heavens ˹in layers˺, and likewise for\nthe earth. The ˹divine˺ command descends between them so you may know\nthat Allah is Most Capable of everything and that Allah certainly\nencompasses all things in ˹His˺ knowledge.\n***\n\n-- 500 of 694 --\n\n66. The Prohibition\n(At-Taḥrîm)\nThis Medinian sûrah deals with an incident that happened within the\nProphet’s household. The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) used to visit all of his wives in\nthe evening. It so happened that he stayed longer than usual at the home of\nZainab bint Ja\nḥsh, where he was offered honey—something he liked very\nmuch. Out of jealousy, two other wives (\nḤaf\nṣah and ’\nȂishah) agreed\nbetween themselves to tell the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), when he visited each of\nthem, that his mouth gave off a bad smell, knowing that he (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) did not\nlike bad smells. Eventually, the Prophet made an oath that he would never\neat honey again, and told\nḤaf\nṣah not to tell anyone about this. But she told\n’\nȂishah that their plan worked. Both wives are subtly advised to learn from\nthe example of the two believing women mentioned at the end of the sûrah—\nMary and\nȂsiyah, the wife of Pharaoh—and take a lesson from the fate of\nthe wives of Noah and Lot, who were both destroyed despite being wives of\nprophets. The believers are urged in this sûrah to mend their ways and\ngenuinely repent to Allah in order to win His eternal reward, whereas the\ndisbelievers are warned of a horrible fate. The fate of the disbelievers is\nelaborated upon in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nA Lesson to the Prophet’s Wives\n1. O Prophet! Why do you prohibit ˹yourself˺ from what Allah has made\nlawful to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is All-Forgiving,\nMost Merciful. 2. Allah has already ordained for you ˹believers˺ the way to\nabsolve yourselves from your oaths.[1211] For Allah is your Guardian. And\nHe is the All-Knowing, All-Wise. 3. ˹Remember˺ when the Prophet had\n˹once˺ confided something to one of his wives, then when she disclosed it\n˹to another wife˺ and Allah made it known to him, he presented ˹to her˺ part\nof what was disclosed and overlooked a part. So when he informed her of it,\nshe exclaimed, “Who told you this?” He replied, “I was informed by the\nAll-Knowing, All-Aware.” 4. ˹It will be better˺ if you ˹wives˺ both turn to\nAllah in repentance, for your hearts have certainly faltered. But if you\n\n-- 501 of 694 --\n\n˹continue to˺ collaborate against him, then ˹know that˺ Allah Himself is his\nGuardian. And Gabriel, the righteous believers, and the angels are ˹all˺ his\nsupporters as well. 5. Perhaps, if he were to divorce you ˹all˺, his Lord\nwould replace you with better wives who are submissive ˹to Allah˺, faithful\n˹to Him˺, devout, repentant, dedicated to worship and fasting—previously\nmarried or virgins.\nWarning of Judgment Day\n6. O believers! Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel\nis people and stones, overseen by formidable and severe angels, who never\ndisobey whatever Allah orders—always doing as commanded. 7. ˹The\ndeniers will then be told,˺ “O disbelievers! Make no excuses this Day! You\nare only rewarded for what you used to do.”\nReward of Sincere Repentance\n8. O believers! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance, so your Lord may\nabsolve you of your sins and admit you into Gardens, under which rivers\nflow, on the Day Allah will not disgrace the Prophet or the believers with\nhim. Their light will shine ahead of them and on their right. They will say,\n“Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us. ˹For˺ You are truly Most\nCapable of everything.”\nResponding to Evildoers\n9. O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be\nfirm with them. Hell will be their home. What an evil destination!\nTwo Examples for the Disbelievers\n10. Allah sets forth an example for the disbelievers: the wife of Noah and\nthe wife of Lot. Each was married to one of Our righteous servants, yet\nbetrayed them.[1212] So their husbands were of no benefit to them against\nAllah whatsoever. Both were told, “Enter the Fire, along with the others!”\nTwo Examples for the Believers\n11. And Allah sets forth an example for the believers: the wife of Pharaoh,\nwho prayed, “My Lord! Build me a house in Paradise near You, deliver me\nfrom Pharaoh and his ˹evil˺ doing, and save me from the wrongdoing\npeople.” 12. ˹There is˺ also ˹the example of˺ Mary, the daughter of ’Imrân,\nwho guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her ˹womb˺ through Our\n\n-- 502 of 694 --\n\nangel ˹Gabriel˺.[1213] She testified to the words of her Lord and His\nScriptures, and was one of the ˹sincerely˺ devout.\n***\n\n-- 503 of 694 --\n\n67. All Authority\n(Al-Mulk)\nThis Meccan sûrah stresses that Allah’s infinite power is manifested through\nHis perfect creation. Those who disbelieve in Allah and deny the\nResurrection will be regretful in Hell, whereas those in awe of their Lord\nwill be richly rewarded in Paradise. Allah’s absolute authority is contrasted\nwith the powerlessness of false gods. The fact that there is no protection\nfrom Allah’s torment is emphasized in this sûrah (verses 20, 21, and 30) and\nthe next (68:17-33).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nLife Is a Test\n1. Blessed is the One in Whose Hands rests all authority. And He is Most\nCapable of everything. 2. ˹He is the One˺ Who created death and life in\norder to test which of you is best in deeds. And He is the Almighty, All-\nForgiving.\nAllah’s Perfect Creation\n3. ˹He is the One˺ Who created seven heavens, one above the other. You\nwill never see any imperfection in the creation of the Most Compassionate.\n[1214] So look again: do you see any flaws? 4. Then look again and again—\nyour sight will return frustrated and weary. 5. And indeed, We adorned the\nlowest heaven with ˹stars like˺ lamps, and made them ˹as missiles˺ for\nstoning ˹eavesdropping˺ devils, for whom We have also prepared the\ntorment of the Blaze.[1215]\nReward of the Disbelievers\n6. Those who disbelieve in their Lord will suffer the punishment of Hell.\nWhat an evil destination! 7. When they are tossed into it, they will hear its\nroaring as it boils over, 8. almost bursting in fury. Every time a group is cast\ninto it, its keepers will ask them, “Did a warner not come to you?” 9. They\nwill reply, “Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied and said, ‘Allah\nhas revealed nothing. You are extremely astray.’” 10. And they will lament,\n“If only we had listened and reasoned, we would not be among the residents\n\n-- 504 of 694 --\n\nof the Blaze!” 11. And so they will confess their sins. So away with the\nresidents of the Blaze!\nReward of the Believers\n12. Indeed, those in awe of their Lord without seeing Him[1216] will have\nforgiveness and a mighty reward.\nQuestion 1) Does Allah Not Know His Creation?\n13. Whether you speak secretly or openly—He surely knows best what is\n˹hidden˺ in the heart. 14. How could He not know His Own creation? For\nHe ˹alone˺ is the Most Subtle, All-Aware. 15. He is the One Who smoothed\nout the earth for you, so move about in its regions and eat from His\nprovisions. And to Him is the resurrection ˹of all˺.\nQuestion 2) Are You out of Allah’s Reach?\n16. Do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not cause the\nearth to swallow you up as it quakes violently? 17. Or do you feel secure\nthat the One Who is in heaven will not unleash upon you a storm of stones.\nOnly then would you know how ˹serious˺ My warning was! 18. And\ncertainly those before them denied ˹as well˺, then how severe was My\nresponse!\nQuestion 3) Do You Not See Allah’s Power?\n19. Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading and folding their\nwings? None holds them up except the Most Compassionate. Indeed, He is\nAll-Seeing of everything. 20. Also, which ˹powerless˺ force will come to\nyour help instead of the Most Compassionate? Indeed, the disbelievers are\nonly ˹lost˺ in delusion. 21. Or who is it that will provide for you if He\nwithholds His provision? In fact, they persist in arrogance and aversion ˹to\nthe truth˺.\nQuestion 4) Are Believers and Disbelievers Equal?\n22. Who is ˹rightly˺ guided: the one who crawls facedown or the one who\nwalks upright on the Straight Path?\nQuestion 5) Who Created You?\n23. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He is the One Who brought you into being and gave\nyou hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks.” 24.\n˹Also˺ say, “He is the One Who has dispersed you ˹all˺ over the earth, and to\nHim you will ˹all˺ be gathered.”\n\n-- 505 of 694 --\n\nQuestion 6) Do You Still Deny the Hour?\n25. ˹Still˺ they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if\nwhat you say is true?” 26. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “That knowledge is with Allah\nalone, and I am only sent with a clear warning.” 27. Then when they see the\ntorment drawing near, the faces of the disbelievers will become gloomy, and\nit will be said ˹to them˺, “This is what you claimed would never\ncome.”[1217]\nQuestion 7) Who Else Can Aid You?\n28. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Consider this: whether Allah causes me and those\nwith me to die or shows us mercy, who will save the disbelievers from a\npainful punishment?”[1218] 29. Say, “He is the Most Compassionate—in\nHim ˹alone˺ we believe, and in Him ˹alone˺ we trust. You will soon know\nwho is clearly astray.” 30. Say, “Consider this: if your water were to sink\n˹into the earth˺, then who ˹else˺ could bring you flowing water?”\n***\n\n-- 506 of 694 --\n\n68. The Pen\n(Al-Qalam)\nIn this Meccan sûrah, the Prophet’s heart is reassured and his character is\nhighly praised. He (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is advised to be steadfast and not to yield to the\npagans who reject his message and call him insane. The pagans are warned\nof an evil fate in this world and the Hereafter. To deter the pagans, the fate\nof some earlier disbelievers is cited in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nExcellence of the Prophet\n1. Nũn. By the pen and what everyone writes! 2. By the grace of your Lord,\nyou ˹O Prophet˺ are not insane. 3. You will certainly have a never-ending\nreward. 4. And you are truly ˹a man˺ of outstanding character. 5. Soon you\nand the pagans will see, 6. which of you is mad. 7. Surely your Lord ˹alone˺\nknows best who has strayed from His Way and who is ˹rightly˺ guided.\nWarning the Prophet About the Deniers\n8. So do not give in to the deniers. 9. They wish you would compromise so\nthey would yield ˹to you˺. 10. And do not obey the despicable, vain oath-\ntaker, 11. slanderer, gossip-monger, 12. withholder of good, transgressor,\nevildoer, 13. brute, and—on top of all that—an illegitimate child. 14. Now,\n˹simply˺ because he has been blessed with ˹abundant˺ wealth and children,\n15. whenever Our revelations are recited to him, he says, “Ancient fables!”\n16. We will soon mark his snout.[1219]\nThe Test of the Garden Owners[1220]\n17. Indeed, We have tested those ˹Meccans˺ as We tested the owners of the\ngarden—when they swore they would surely harvest ˹all˺ its fruit in the\nearly morning, 18. leaving no thought for Allah’s Will.[1221] 19. Then it was\nstruck by a torment from your Lord while they slept, 20. so it was reduced\nto ashes. 21. Then by daybreak they called out to each other, 22. ˹saying,˺\n“Go early to your harvest, if you want to pick ˹all˺ the fruit.” 23. So they\nwent off, whispering to one another, 24. “Do not let any poor person enter\nyour garden today.” 25. And they proceeded early, totally fixated on their\n\n-- 507 of 694 --\n\npurpose. 26. But when they saw it ˹devastated˺, they cried, “We must have\nlost ˹our˺ way! 27. In fact, we have been deprived ˹of our livelihood˺.” 28.\nThe most sensible of them said, “Did I not urge you to say, ‘Allah\nwilling.’?” 29. They replied, “Glory be to our Lord! We have truly been\nwrongdoers.” 30. Then they turned on each other, throwing blame. 31. They\nsaid, “Woe to us! We have certainly been transgressors. 32. We trust our\nLord will give us a better garden than this, ˹for˺ we are indeed turning to our\nLord with hope.”[1222] 33. That is the ˹way of Our˺ punishment ˹in this\nworld˺. But the punishment of the Hereafter is certainly far worse, if only\nthey knew.[1223]\nQuestions to the Pagans\n34. Indeed, the righteous will have the Gardens of Bliss with their Lord. 35.\nShould We then treat those who have submitted like the wicked? 36. What\nis the matter with you? How do you judge? 37. Or do you have a scripture,\nin which you read 38. that you will have whatever you choose? 39. Or do\nyou have oaths binding on Us until the Day of Judgment that you will have\nwhatever you decide? 40. Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ which of them can\nguarantee all that. 41. Or do they have associate-gods ˹supporting this\nclaim˺? Then let them bring forth their associate-gods, if what they say is\ntrue.\nWarning of Judgment Day\n42. ˹Beware of˺ the Day the Shin ˹of Allah˺ will be bared,[1224] and the\nwicked will be asked to prostrate, but they will not be able to do so, 43.\nwith eyes downcast, totally covered with disgrace. For they were ˹always˺\ncalled to prostrate ˹in the world˺ when they were fully capable ˹but they\nchose not to˺. 44. So leave to Me ˹O Prophet˺ those who reject this message.\nWe will gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot\ncomprehend. 45. I ˹only˺ delay their end for a while, but My planning is\nflawless. 46. Or are you asking them for a reward ˹for the message˺ so that\nthey are overburdened by debt? 47. Or do they have access to ˹the Record\nin˺ the unseen, so they copy it ˹for all to see˺?\nA Lesson to the Prophet\n48. So be patient with your Lord’s decree, and do not be like ˹Jonah,˺ the\nMan of the Whale, who cried out ˹to Allah˺, in total distress.[1225] 49. Had\n\n-- 508 of 694 --\n\nhe not been shown grace by his Lord, he would have certainly been cast\nonto the open ˹shore˺, still blameworthy. 50. Then his Lord chose him,\nmaking him one of the righteous. 51. The disbelievers would almost cut you\ndown with their eyes when they hear ˹you recite˺ the Reminder,[1226] and\nsay, “He is certainly a madman.” 52. But it is simply a reminder to the\nwhole world.\n***\n\n-- 509 of 694 --\n\n69. The Inevitable Hour\n(Al-\nḤâqqah)\nThis Meccan sûrah refers to the destruction of the peoples of ’\nȂd, Thamûd,\nPharaoh, and Lot (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) for denying the Hereafter. A reference is made\nto the apocalypse, followed by a touching description of the reward of the\nbelievers and the punishment of the disbelievers (verses 18-37). The pagan\narguments against the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and the Quran are thoroughly\nrefuted (verses 38-52). The horrors of the apocalypse are further described\nin the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Final Hour\n1. The Inevitable Hour! 2. What is the Inevitable Hour? 3. And what will\nmake you realize what the Inevitable Hour is?\nExamples of Destroyed Peoples\n4. ˹Both˺ Thamûd and ’Ȃd denied the Striking Disaster.[1227] 5. As for\nThamûd, they were destroyed by an overwhelming blast. 6. And as for ’Ȃd,\nthey were destroyed by a furious, bitter wind 7. which Allah unleashed on\nthem non-stop for seven nights and eight days, so that you would have seen\nits people lying dead like trunks of uprooted palm trees. 8. Do you see any\nof them left alive? 9. Also, Pharaoh and those before him, and ˹the people\nof˺ the overturned cities ˹of Lot˺ indulged in sin, 10. each disobeying their\nLord’s messenger, so He seized them with a crushing grip. 11. Indeed, when\nthe floodwater had overflowed, We carried you[1228] in the floating Ark\n˹with Noah˺, 12. so that We may make this a reminder to you, and that\nattentive ears may grasp it.\nHorrors of Judgment Day\n13. At last, when the Trumpet will be blown with one blast, 14. and the\nearth and mountains will be lifted up and crushed with one blow, 15. on that\nDay the Inevitable Event will have come to pass. 16. The sky will then be\nso torn that it will be frail, 17. with the angels on its sides. On that Day\neight ˹mighty angels˺ will bear the Throne of your Lord above them. 18.\n\n-- 510 of 694 --\n\nYou will then be presented ˹before Him for judgment˺, and none of your\nsecrets will stay hidden.\nThe Winners\n19. As for those given their records in their right hand, they will cry\n˹happily˺, “Here ˹everyone˺! Read my record! 20. I surely knew I would\nface my reckoning.” 21. They will be in a life of bliss, 22. in an elevated\nGarden, 23. whose fruit will hang within reach. 24. ˹They will be told,˺ “Eat\nand drink joyfully for what you did in the days gone by.”\nThe Losers\n25. And as for those given their record in their left hand, they will cry\n˹bitterly˺, “I wish I had not been given my record, 26. nor known anything\nof my reckoning! 27. I wish death was the end! 28. My wealth has not\nbenefited me! 29. My authority has been stripped from me.” 30. ˹It will be\nsaid,˺ “Seize and shackle them, 31. then burn them in Hell, 32. then tie them\nup with chains seventy arms long. 33. For they never had faith in Allah, the\nGreatest, 34. nor encouraged the feeding of the poor. 35. So this Day they\nwill have no close friend here, 36. nor any food except ˹oozing˺ pus, 37.\nwhich none will eat except the evildoers.”\nThe Quran Is Allah’s Word\n38. Now, I do swear by whatever you see, 39. and whatever you cannot see!\n40. Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the recitation of a noble Messenger. 41. It is not\nthe prose of a poet ˹as you claim˺, ˹yet˺ you hardly have any faith. 42. Nor is\nit the mumbling of a fortune-teller, ˹yet˺ you are hardly mindful. 43. ˹It is˺ a\nrevelation from the Lord of all worlds.\nThe Quran Is Not a Fabrication\n44. Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name, 45. We would\nhave certainly seized him by his right hand, 46. then severed his aorta, 47.\nand none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺!\nThe Quran Is the Absolute Truth\n48. Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is a reminder to those mindful ˹of Allah˺. 49. And\nWe certainly know that some of you will persist in denial, 50. and it will\nsurely be a source of regret for the disbelievers. 51. And indeed, this\n˹Quran˺ is the absolute truth. 52. So glorify the Name of your Lord, the\nGreatest.\n\n-- 511 of 694 --\n\n***\n\n-- 512 of 694 --\n\n70. Pathways of ˹Heavenly˺ Ascent\n(Al-Ma’ârij)\nThis Meccan sûrah, which takes its name from verse 3, condemns the\npagans for ridiculing the Day of Judgment (verses 1-2) and the Prophet\n(verses 36-37). The truth of the Hour is reaffirmed, along with the horrors\nthat will ensue. The qualities of the people of Hell and the people of\nParadise are described (verses 16-35). The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reassured,\nwhile the pagans are warned—both themes are embedded in the story of\nNoah (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nA Mocker Asks for Judgment Day\n1. A challenger[1229] has demanded a punishment bound to come 2. for the\ndisbelievers—to be averted by none— 3. from Allah, Lord of pathways of\n˹heavenly˺ ascent, 4. ˹through which˺ the angels and the ˹holy˺ spirit[1230]\nwill ascend to Him on a Day fifty thousand years in length.[1231] 5. So\nendure ˹this denial, O Prophet,˺ with beautiful patience. 6. They truly see\nthis ˹Day˺ as impossible, 7. but We see it as inevitable.\nHorrors of Judgment Day\n8. On that Day the sky will be like molten brass 9. and the mountains like\n˹tufts of˺ wool. 10. And no close friend will ask ˹about˺ their friends, 11.\n˹although˺ they will be made to see each other. The wicked will wish to\nransom themselves from the punishment of that Day by their children, 12.\ntheir spouses, their siblings, 13. their clan that sheltered them, 14. and\neveryone on earth altogether, just to save themselves. 15. But no! There will\ncertainly be a raging Flame 16. ripping off scalps. 17. It will summon\nwhoever turned their backs ˹on Allah˺ and turned away ˹from the truth˺, 18.\nand gathered and hoarded ˹wealth˺.\nExcellence of the Faithful\n19. Indeed, humankind was created impatient: 20. distressed when touched\nwith evil, 21. and withholding when touched with good— 22. except those\nwho pray, 23. consistently performing their prayers; 24. and who give the\n\n-- 513 of 694 --\n\nrightful share of their wealth 25. to the beggar and the poor; 26. and who\n˹firmly˺ believe in the Day of Judgment; 27. and those who fear the\npunishment of their Lord— 28. ˹knowing that˺ none should feel secure from\ntheir Lord’s punishment— 29. and those who guard their chastity[1232] 30.\nexcept with their wives or those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession,[1233] for\nthen they are free from blame, 31. but whoever seeks beyond that are the\ntransgressors. 32. ˹The faithful are˺ also those who are true to their trusts\nand covenants; 33. and who are honest in their testimony; 34. and who are\n˹properly˺ observant of their prayers. 35. These will be in Gardens, held in\nhonour.\nWarning to the Mockers\n36. So what is the matter with the disbelievers that they rush ˹head-long˺\ntowards you ˹O Prophet˺, 37. from the right and the left, in groups ˹to mock\nyou˺?[1234] 38. Does every one of them expect to be admitted into a Garden\nof Bliss? 39. But no! Indeed, they ˹already˺ know what We created them\nfrom.[1235] 40. So, I do swear by the Lord of ˹all˺ the points of sunrise and\nsunset[1236] that We are truly capable 41. of replacing them with ˹others˺\nbetter than them, and We cannot be prevented ˹from doing so˺. 42. So let\nthem indulge ˹in falsehood˺ and amuse ˹themselves˺ until they face their\nDay, which they have been threatened with— 43. the Day they will come\nforth from the graves swiftly, as if racing to an idol ˹for a blessing˺,[1237] 44.\nwith eyes downcast, utterly covered with disgrace. That is the Day they\nhave ˹always˺ been warned of.\n***\n\n-- 514 of 694 --\n\n71. Noah\n(Nû\nḥ)\nThis Meccan sûrah describes how Noah (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) strived to deliver the\nmessage to his people for 950 years (corresponding to the total number of\nArabic letters in this sûrah). He called them to the truth secretly and\npublically, using logical arguments to prove the mercy and oneness of\nAllah. But his people persisted in denial, only to perish in the Flood. The\nstubbornness of the Arab pagans in the previous sûrah and the long denial\nof the people of Noah in this sûrah are contrasted with how some jinn\ninstantly believed once they heard the truth in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nNoah’s Appeal to His People\n1. Indeed, We sent Noah to his people ˹saying to him˺, “Warn your people\nbefore a painful punishment comes to them.” 2. Noah proclaimed, “O my\npeople! I am truly sent to you with a clear warning: 3. worship Allah\n˹alone˺, fear Him, and obey me. 4. He will forgive your sins, and delay your\nend until the appointed time.[1238] Indeed, when the time set by Allah\ncomes, it cannot be delayed, if only you knew!”\n950 Years of Preaching\n5. He cried, “My Lord! I have surely called my people day and night, 6. but\nmy calls only made them run farther away. 7. And whenever I invite them\nto be forgiven by You, they press their fingers into their ears, cover\nthemselves with their clothes, persist ˹in denial˺, and act very arrogantly. 8.\nThen I certainly called them openly, 9. then I surely preached to them\npublicly and privately, 10. saying, ‘Seek your Lord’s forgiveness, ˹for˺ He is\ntruly Most Forgiving. 11. He will shower you with abundant rain, 12.\nsupply you with wealth and children, and give you gardens as well as rivers.\n13. What is the matter with you that you are not in awe of the Majesty of\nAllah, 14. when He truly created you in stages ˹of development˺?[1239] 15.\nDo you not see how Allah created seven heavens, one above the other, 16.\nplacing the moon within them as a ˹reflected˺ light, and the sun as a\n\n-- 515 of 694 --\n\n˹radiant˺ lamp? 17. Allah ˹alone˺ caused you[1240] to grow from the earth\nlike a plant. 18. Then He will return you to it, and then simply bring you\nforth ˹again˺. 19. And Allah ˹alone˺ spread out the earth for you 20. to walk\nalong its spacious pathways.’”\nThe Flood\n21. ˹Eventually,˺ Noah cried, “My Lord! They have certainly persisted in\ndisobeying me, and followed ˹instead˺ those ˹elite˺ whose ˹abundant˺ wealth\nand children only increase them in loss, 22. and who have devised a\ntremendous plot, 23. urging ˹their followers˺, ‘Do not abandon your idols—\nespecially Wadd, Suwâ’, Yaghûth, Ya’ûq, and Nasr.’[1241] 24. Those ˹elite˺\nhave already led many astray. So ˹O Lord˺, only allow the wrongdoers to\nstray farther away.” 25. So because of their sins, they were drowned, then\nadmitted into the Fire. And they found none to help them against Allah.\nNoah’s Prayer Before the Flood[1242]\n26. Noah had prayed, “My Lord! Do not leave a single disbeliever on earth.\n27. For if You spare ˹any of˺ them, they will certainly mislead Your\nservants, and give birth only to ˹wicked˺ sinners, staunch disbelievers. 28.\nMy Lord! Forgive me, my parents, and whoever enters my house in faith,\nand ˹all˺ believing men and women. And increase the wrongdoers only in\ndestruction.”\n***\n\n-- 516 of 694 --\n\n72. The Jinn\n(Al-Jinn)\nThis Meccan sûrah gives an account of a group of jinn who fully submitted\nto the One True God as soon as they heard the Prophet’s recitation of the\nQuran. In comparison, the Arab pagans are criticized for their polytheistic\nbeliefs. The pagans are told that the Prophet’s duty is only to deliver the\nmessage. Bringing about the punishment, which the pagans demanded, is\nonly within the power of Allah. The next sûrah provides more warning to\nthe pagans and reassurance to the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nSome Jinn Embrace Islam\n1. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It has been revealed to me that a group of jinn listened\n˹to the Quran,˺ and said ˹to their fellow jinn˺: ‘Indeed, we have heard a\nwondrous recitation. 2. It leads to Right Guidance so we believed in it, and\nwe will never associate anyone with our Lord ˹in worship˺. 3. ˹Now, we\nbelieve that˺ our Lord—Exalted is His Majesty—has neither taken a mate\nnor offspring, 4. and that the foolish of us used to utter ˹outrageous˺\nfalsehoods about Allah.[1243] 5. We certainly thought that humans and jinn\nwould never speak lies about Allah. 6. And some men used to seek refuge\nwith some jinn—so they increased each other in wickedness.[1244] 7. And\nthose ˹humans˺ thought, just like you ˹jinn˺, that Allah would not resurrect\nanyone ˹for judgment˺.\nNo More Eavesdropping on Heaven\n8. ˹Earlier˺ we tried to reach heaven ˹for news˺, only to find it filled with\nstern guards and shooting stars.[1245] 9. We used to take up positions there\nfor eavesdropping, but whoever dares eavesdrop now will find a flare lying\nin wait for them. 10. Now, we have no clue whether evil is intended for\nthose on earth, or their Lord intends for them what is right.\nRighteous and Deviant Jinn\n11. Among us are those who are righteous and those who are less so. We\nhave been of different factions. 12. ˹Now,˺ we truly know that we cannot\n\n-- 517 of 694 --\n\nfrustrate Allah on earth, nor can we escape from Him ˹into heaven˺. 13.\nWhen we heard the guidance ˹of the Quran˺, we ˹readily˺ believed in it. For\nwhoever believes in their Lord will have no fear of being denied ˹a reward˺\nor wronged. 14. And among us are those who have submitted ˹to Allah˺ and\nthose who are deviant. So ˹as for˺ those who submitted, it is they who have\nattained Right Guidance. 15. And as for the deviant, they will be fuel for\nHell.’”\nA Message to the Deniers\n16. Had the deniers followed the Right Way, We would have certainly\ngranted them abundant rain to drink— 17. as a test for them.[1246] And\nwhoever turns away from the remembrance of their Lord will be admitted\nby Him into an overwhelming punishment.\nWorship Allah Alone\n18. The places of worship are ˹only˺ for Allah, so do not invoke anyone\nbesides Him. 19. Yet when the servant of Allah[1247] stood up calling upon\nHim ˹alone˺, the pagans almost swarmed over him. 20. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I\ncall only upon my Lord, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺.” 21. Say,\n“It is not in my power to harm or benefit you.” 22. Say, “No one can protect\nme from Allah ˹if I were to disobey Him˺, nor can I find any refuge other\nthan Him. 23. ˹My duty is˺ only to convey ˹the truth˺ from Allah and\n˹deliver˺ His messages.” And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger\nwill certainly be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there for ever and ever.\nWarning to Pagan Deniers\n24. Only when they see what they have been threatened with will they\nknow who is weaker in helpers and inferior in manpower. 25. Say, “I do not\nknow if what you are promised is near or my Lord has set a distant time for\nit. 26. ˹He is the˺ Knower of the unseen, disclosing none of it to anyone, 27.\nexcept messengers of His choice. Then He appoints angel-guards before\nand behind them 28. to ensure that the messengers fully deliver the\nmessages of their Lord—though He ˹already˺ knows all about them, and\nkeeps account of everything.”\n***\n\n-- 518 of 694 --\n\n73. The Wrapped One\n(Al-Muzzammil)\nThis early Meccan sûrah prepares the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) for the\ncommandments yet to be revealed and the challenges ahead. The Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is advised, both in this sûrah and the next, to seek comfort in\npatience and prayer, whereas the arrogant disbelievers are warned of a\nhorrible punishment in Hell.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nEmpowering the Prophet Through Prayer\n1. O you wrapped ˹in your clothes˺! 2. Stand all night ˹in prayer˺ except a\nlittle— 3. ˹pray˺ half the night, or a little less, 4. or a little more—and recite\nthe Quran ˹properly˺ in a measured way. 5. ˹For˺ We will soon send upon\nyou a weighty revelation. 6. Indeed, worship in the night is more impactful\nand suitable for recitation. 7. For during the day you are over-occupied\n˹with worldly duties˺. 8. ˹Always˺ remember the Name of your Lord, and\ndevote yourself to Him wholeheartedly. 9. ˹He is the˺ Lord of the east and\nthe west. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, so take Him\n˹alone˺ as a Trustee of Affairs.\nReassuring the Prophet\n10. Be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say, and depart from them\ncourteously. 11. And leave to Me the deniers—the people of luxury—and\nbear with them for a little while. 12. ˹For˺ We certainly have shackles, a\n˹raging˺ Fire, 13. choking food, and a painful punishment ˹in store for them˺\n14. on the Day the earth and mountains will shake ˹violently˺, and\nmountains will be ˹reduced to˺ dunes of shifting sand.\nA Warning to the Polytheists\n15. Indeed, We have sent to you a messenger as a witness over you, just as\nWe sent a messenger to Pharaoh. 16. But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger,\nso We seized him with a stern grip. 17. If you ˹pagans˺ persist in disbelief,\nthen how will you guard yourselves against ˹the horrors of˺ a Day which\nwill turn children’s hair grey? 18. It will ˹even˺ cause the sky to split apart.\n\n-- 519 of 694 --\n\nHis promise ˹of judgment˺ must be fulfilled. 19. Surely this is a reminder.\nSo let whoever wills take the ˹Right˺ Way to their Lord.\nNight Prayers Eased\n20. Surely your Lord knows that you ˹O Prophet˺ stand ˹in prayer˺ for\nnearly two-thirds of the night, or ˹sometimes˺ half of it, or a third, as do\nsome of those with you. Allah ˹alone˺ keeps a ˹precise˺ measure of the day\nand night. He knows that you ˹believers˺ are unable to endure this, and has\nturned to you in mercy.[1248] So recite ˹in prayer˺ whatever you can from the\nQuran. He knows that some of you will be sick, some will be travelling\nthroughout the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and some fighting in the cause\nof Allah. So recite whatever you can from it. And ˹continue to˺ perform\n˹regular˺ prayers, pay alms-tax, and lend to Allah a good loan.[1249]\nWhatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah far\nbetter and more rewarding.[1250] And seek Allah’s forgiveness. Surely Allah\nis All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n***\n\n-- 520 of 694 --\n\n74. The One Covered up\n(Al-Muddaththir)\nFollowing his first encounter with the angel Gabriel at a cave in the\noutskirts of Mecca, the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) rushed to his house in total shock,\nasking his wife to cover him up with his cloak. Later, this Meccan sûrah was\nrevealed, urging him (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to shoulder the responsibility of delivering\nthe message. Allah promises to deal with the pagan tyrants who oppose the\ntruth, defame the Quran, and ridicule warnings of Hell. The pagan denial of\nthe Hereafter is dealt with in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nA Message to the Prophet\n1. O you covered up ˹in your clothes˺! 2. Arise and warn ˹all˺. 3. Revere\nyour Lord ˹alone˺. 4. Purify your garments. 5. ˹Continue to˺ shun idols. 6.\nDo not do a favour expecting more ˹in return˺.[1251] 7. And persevere for\n˹the sake of˺ your Lord. 8. ˹For˺ when the Trumpet will be sounded,[1252] 9.\nthat will ˹truly˺ be a difficult Day— 10. far from easy for the disbelievers.\nThe Fate of a Denier[1253]\n11. And leave to me ˹O Prophet˺ the one I created all by Myself, 12. and\ngranted him abundant wealth, 13. and children always by his side, 14. and\nmade life very easy for him. 15. Yet he is hungry for more. 16. But no! ˹For˺\nhe has been truly stubborn with Our revelations. 17. I will make his fate\nunbearable, 18. for he contemplated and determined ˹a degrading label for\nthe Quran˺. 19. May he be condemned! How evil was what he determined!\n20. May he be condemned even more! How evil was what he determined!\n21. Then he re-contemplated ˹in frustration˺, 22. then frowned and scowled,\n23. then turned his back ˹on the truth˺ and acted arrogantly, 24. saying,\n“This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but magic from the ancients. 25. This is no more\nthan the word of a man.” 26. Soon I will burn him in Hell! 27. And what\nwill make you realize what Hell is? 28. It does not let anyone live or die,\n[1254] 29. scorching the skin. 30. It is overseen by nineteen ˹keepers˺.\nThe Nineteen Keepers of Hell\n\n-- 521 of 694 --\n\n31. We have appointed only ˹stern˺ angels as wardens of the Fire. And We\nhave made their number only as a test for the disbelievers,[1255] so that the\nPeople of the Book will be certain, and the believers will increase in faith,\nand neither the People of the Book nor the believers will have any doubts,\nand so that those ˹hypocrites˺ with sickness in their hearts and the\ndisbelievers will argue, “What does Allah mean by such a number?” In this\nway Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills.\nAnd none knows the forces of your Lord except He. And this ˹description\nof Hell˺ is only a reminder to humanity.\nWarning of Hell\n32. But no! By the moon, 33. and the night as it retreats, 34. and the day as\nit breaks! 35. Surely Hell is one of the mightiest catastrophes— 36. a\nwarning to humankind, 37. to whichever of you chooses to take the lead or\nlag behind.\nWhat Leads the Wicked to Hell\n38. Every soul will be detained for what it has done, 39. except the people\nof the right, 40. who will be in Gardens, asking one another 41. about the\nwicked ˹who will then be asked˺: 42. “What has landed you in Hell?” 43.\nThey will reply, “We were not of those who prayed, 44. nor did we feed the\npoor. 45. We used to indulge ˹in falsehood˺ along with others, 46. and deny\nthe Day of Judgment, 47. until the inevitable came to us.” 48. So the pleas\nof intercessors will be of no benefit to them.\nWarning to Pagan Deniers\n49. Now, what is the matter with them that they are turning away from the\nreminder, 50. as if they were spooked zebras 51. fleeing from a lion? 52. In\nfact, each one of them wishes to be given a ˹personal˺ letter ˹from Allah˺ for\nall ˹to read˺.[1256] 53. But no! In fact, they do not fear the Hereafter. 54.\nEnough! Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a reminder. 55. So let whoever wills be\nmindful of it. 56. But they cannot do so unless Allah wills. He ˹alone˺ is\nworthy to be feared and entitled to forgive.\n***\n\n-- 522 of 694 --\n\n75. The ˹Rising for˺ Judgment\n(Al-Qiyamah)\nThis Meccan sûrah refutes the pagan denial of resurrection and judgment.\nThe sûrah makes it clear that death and judgment are inescapable. The fact\nthat Allah created humans from humble fluids and is able to bring all to\naccount is detailed in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWarning to Deniers of Resurrection\n1. I do swear by the Day of Judgment! 2. And I do swear by the self-\nreproaching soul! 3. Do people think We cannot reassemble their bones? 4.\nYes ˹indeed˺! We are ˹most˺ capable of restoring ˹even˺ their very fingertips.\n[1257] 5. Still people want to deny what is yet to come, 6. asking\n˹mockingly˺, “When is this Day of Judgment?” 7. But when the sight is\nstunned, 8. and the moon is dimmed, 9. and the sun and the moon are\nbrought together,[1258] 10. on that Day one will cry, “Where is the escape?”\n11. But no! There will be no refuge. 12. On that Day all will end up before\nyour Lord. 13. All will then be informed of what they have sent forth and\nleft behind. 14. In fact, people will testify against their own souls,[1259] 15.\ndespite the excuses they come up with.\nThe Prophet’s Rush to Memorize the Quran\n16. Do not rush your tongue trying to memorize ˹a revelation of˺ the Quran.\n17. It is certainly upon Us to ˹make you˺ memorize and recite it. 18. So\nonce We have recited a revelation ˹through Gabriel˺, follow its recitation\n˹closely˺. 19. Then it is surely upon Us to make it clear ˹to you˺.\nAnother Warning to the Deniers\n20. But no! In fact, you love this fleeting world, 21. and neglect the\nHereafter. 22. On that Day ˹some˺ faces will be bright, 23. looking at their\nLord. 24. And ˹other˺ faces will be gloomy, 25. anticipating something\ndevastating to befall them.\nDeath of a Denier\n\n-- 523 of 694 --\n\n26. But no! ˹Beware of the day˺ when the soul reaches the collar bone ˹as it\nleaves˺, 27. and it will be said, “Is there any healer ˹who can save this\nlife˺?” 28. And the dying person realizes it is ˹their˺ time to depart, 29. and\n˹then˺ their feet are tied together ˹in a shroud˺. 30. On that day they will be\ndriven to your Lord ˹alone˺. 31. This denier neither believed nor prayed, 32.\nbut persisted in denial and turned away, 33. then went to their own people,\nwalking boastfully. 34. Woe to you, and more woe! 35. Again, woe to you,\nand even more woe!\nAllah’s Ability to Create and Resurrect\n36. Do people think they will be left without purpose? 37. Were they not\n˹once˺ a sperm-drop emitted? 38. Then they became a clinging clot ˹of\nblood˺,[1260] then He developed and perfected their form, 39. producing\nfrom it both sexes, male and female. 40. Is such ˹a Creator˺ unable to bring\nthe dead back to life?\n***\n\n-- 524 of 694 --\n\n76. Humans\n(Al-Insân)\nThis Meccan sûrah reminds the human beings of how Allah created them,\nequipped them with different faculties, showed them the Way, and gave them\nfree choice. The reward of those who choose to believe is mentioned at\nlength in this sûrah but passingly in the next sûrah (77:41-44), whereas the\nreward of those who choose to disbelieve is mentioned passingly in this\nsûrah (verse 4) but in great detail in the next. The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is\nadvised to be steadfast and not yield to the deniers of Judgment Day.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nFree Choice\n1. Is there not a period of time when each human is nothing yet worth\nmentioning?[1261] 2. ˹For˺ indeed, We ˹alone˺ created humans from a drop of\nmixed fluids,[1262] ˹in order˺ to test them, so We made them hear and see. 3.\nWe already showed them the Way, whether they ˹choose to˺ be grateful or\nungrateful.\nReward of the Ungrateful\n4. Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains, shackles, and a\nblazing Fire.\nReward of the Grateful\n5. Indeed, the virtuous will have a drink ˹of pure wine˺—flavoured with\ncamphor— 6. ˹from˺ a spring where Allah’s servants will drink, flowing at\ntheir will. 7. They ˹are those who˺ fulfil ˹their˺ vows and fear a Day of\nsweeping horror, 8. and give food—despite their desire for it—to the poor,\nthe orphan, and the captive, 9. ˹saying to themselves,˺ “We feed you only\nfor the sake of Allah, seeking neither reward nor thanks from you. 10. We\nfear from our Lord a horribly distressful Day.” 11. So Allah will deliver\nthem from the horror of that Day, and grant them radiance and joy, 12. and\nreward them for their perseverance with a Garden ˹in Paradise˺ and\n˹garments of˺ silk.\nPleasures in Paradise\n\n-- 525 of 694 --\n\n13. There they will be reclining on ˹canopied˺ couches, never seeing\nscorching heat or bitter cold.[1263] 14. The Garden’s shade will be right\nabove them, and its fruit will be made very easy to reach. 15. They will be\nwaited on with silver vessels and cups of crystal— 16. crystalline silver,\nfilled precisely as desired. 17. And they will be given a drink ˹of pure wine˺\nflavoured with ginger 18. from a spring there, called Salsabîl. 19. They will\nbe waited on by eternal youths. If you saw them, you would think they were\nscattered pearls. 20. And if you looked around, you would see\n˹indescribable˺ bliss and a vast kingdom. 21. The virtuous will be ˹dressed˺\nin garments of fine green silk and rich brocade, and adorned with bracelets\nof silver, and their Lord will give them a purifying drink.[1264] 22. ˹And they\nwill be told,˺ “All this is surely a reward for you. Your striving has been\nappreciated.”\nReassuring the Prophet\n23. Indeed, it is We Who have revealed the Quran to you ˹O Prophet˺ in\nstages. 24. So be patient with your Lord’s decree, and do not yield to any\nevildoer or ˹staunch˺ disbeliever from among them. 25. ˹Always˺ remember\nthe Name of your Lord morning and evening, 26. and prostrate before Him\nduring part of the night,[1265] and glorify Him long at night.[1266]\nA Message to the Deniers\n27. Surely those ˹pagans˺ love this fleeting world, ˹totally˺ neglecting a\nweighty Day ahead of them. 28. It is We Who created them and perfected\ntheir ˹physical˺ form. But if We will, We can easily replace them with\nothers. 29. Surely this is a reminder. So let whoever wills take the ˹Right˺\nWay to their Lord. 30. But you cannot will ˹to do so˺ unless Allah wills.\nIndeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. 31. He admits whoever He wills\ninto His mercy. As for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful\npunishment\n***\n\n-- 526 of 694 --\n\n77. Those ˹Winds˺ Sent Forth\n(Al-Mursalât)\nLike the two previous sûrahs and the next two sûrahs, this Meccan sûrah\nmakes it clear that Allah’s power to create should be taken as a proof of His\nability to bring the dead back to life for judgment. The horrors of the Hour\nand the punishment of the wicked are stated in strong terms.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nJudgment Day Is Inevitable\n1. By those ˹winds˺ sent forth successively, 2. and those blowing violently,\n3. and those scattering ˹rainclouds˺ widely! 4.

So when the stars are put out, 9. and the sky is torn apart, 10. and the\nmountains are blown away, 11. and the messengers’ time ˹to testify˺ comes\nup—12. for which Day has all this been set? 13. For the Day of ˹Final˺\nDecision! 14. And what will make you realize what the Day of Decision is?\n15. Woe on that Day to the deniers!\nAllah’s Infinite Power\n16. Did We not destroy earlier disbelievers? 17. And We will make the later\ndisbelievers follow them. 18. This is how We deal with the wicked. 19. Woe\non that Day to the deniers! 20. Did We not create you from a humble fluid,\n21. placing it in a secure place 22. until an appointed time?[1267] 23. We\n˹perfectly˺ ordained ˹its development˺. How excellent are We in doing so!\n24. Woe on that Day to the deniers! 25. Have We not made the earth a\nlodging 26. for the living and the dead, 27. and placed upon it towering,\nfirm mountains, and given you fresh water to drink? 28. Woe on that Day to\nthe deniers!\nBad News for the Deniers of Hell\n\n-- 527 of 694 --\n\n29. ˹The disbelievers will be told,˺ “Proceed into that ˹Fire˺ which you used\nto deny! 30.

Woe on that Day to the deniers! 35. On that Day they will\nnot ˹be in a position to˺ speak, 36. nor will they be permitted to offer\nexcuses. 37. Woe on that Day to the deniers! 38. ˹They will be told by\nAllah,˺ “This is the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision: We have gathered you along\nwith earlier disbelievers ˹for punishment˺. 39. So if you have a scheme ˹to\nsave yourselves˺, then use it against Me.” 40. Woe on that Day to the\ndeniers!\nGood News for the Believers\n41. Indeed, the righteous will be amid ˹cool˺ shade and springs 42. and any\nfruit they desire. 43. ˹They will be told,˺ “Eat and drink happily for what\nyou used to do.” 44. Surely this is how We reward the good-doers. 45. ˹But˺\nwoe on that Day to the deniers!\nWarning to the Deniers\n46. “Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while, ˹for˺ you are truly wicked.”\n47.

The Momentous News\n(An-Naba')\nThis Meccan sûrah thoroughly refutes the arguments of those who deny the\nHereafter by citing some of the marvels of Allah’s creation to prove His\nability to raise the dead to life and reward everyone according to their\ndeeds.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nPagans Mock the Truth\n1. What are they asking one another about? 2. About the momentous news,\n3. over which they disagree.[1269] 4. But no! They will come to know. 5.\nAgain, no!

Have We not smoothed out the earth ˹like a bed˺, 7. and ˹made˺ the\nmountains as ˹its˺ pegs,[1270] 8. and created you in pairs, 9. and made your\nsleep for rest, 10. and made the night as a cover, 11. and made the day for\nlivelihood, 12. and built above you seven mighty ˹heavens˺, 13. and placed\n˹in them˺ a shining lamp, 14. and sent down from rainclouds pouring water,\n15. producing by it grain and ˹various˺ plants, 16. and dense orchards?\nHorrors of Judgment Day\n17. Indeed, the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision is an appointed time— 18. ˹it is˺ the\nDay the Trumpet will be blown, and you will ˹all˺ come forth in crowds. 19.\nThe sky will be ˹split˺ open, becoming ˹many˺ gates, 20. and the mountains\nwill be blown away, becoming ˹like˺ a mirage.\nPunishment of the Disbelievers\n21. Indeed, Hell is lying in ambush 22. as a home for the transgressors, 23.\nwhere they will remain for ˹endless˺ ages. 24. There they will not taste any\ncoolness or drink, 25. except boiling water and ˹oozing˺ pus— 26. a fitting\nreward. 27. For they never expected any reckoning, 28. and totally rejected\nOur signs. 29. And We have everything recorded precisely. 30. ˹So the\ndeniers will be told,˺ “Taste ˹the punishment˺, for all you will get from Us is\nmore torment.”\n\n-- 529 of 694 --\n\nReward of the Believers\n31. Indeed, the righteous will have salvation— 32. Gardens, vineyards, 33.\nand full-bosomed maidens of equal age, 34. and full cups ˹of pure wine˺,\n35. never to hear any idle talk or lying therein—36. a ˹fitting˺ reward as a\ngenerous gift from your Lord, 37. the Lord of the heavens and the earth and\neverything in between, the Most Compassionate. No one will dare speak to\nHim 38. on the Day the ˹holy˺ spirit[1271] and the angels will stand in ranks.\nNone will talk, except those granted permission by the Most Compassionate\nand whose words are true. 39.

Those ˹Angels˺ Stripping out ˹Souls˺\n(An-Nâzi’ât)\nThis Meccan sûrah emphasizes that the Day of Judgment is inevitable and\nits time is known only to Allah. The destruction of Pharaoh is cited as a\ndeterrent to the disbelievers.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Hereafter Is Inevitable\n1. By those ˹angels˺ stripping out ˹evil souls˺ harshly, 2. and those pulling\nout ˹good souls˺ gently, 3. and those gliding ˹through heavens˺ swiftly, 4.\nand those taking the lead vigorously, 5. and those conducting affairs\n˹obediently˺! 6. ˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ the quaking Blast will come to\npass,[1273] 7. followed by a second Blast. 8. ˹The deniers’˺ hearts on that\nDay will be trembling ˹in horror˺, 9. with their eyes downcast. 10. ˹But\nnow˺ they ask ˹mockingly˺, “Will we really be restored to our former state,\n11. even after we have been reduced to decayed bones?” 12. Adding, “Then\nsuch a return would be a ˹total˺ loss ˹for us˺!” 13. But indeed, it will take\nonly one ˹mighty˺ Blast, 14. and at once they will be above ground.\nPharaoh Destroyed for Denial\n15. Has the story of Moses reached you ˹O Prophet˺? 16. His Lord called\nhim in the sacred valley of Ṭuwa, 17. ˹commanding,˺ “Go to Pharaoh, for\nhe has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺. 18. And say, ‘Would you ˹be willing\nto˺ purify yourself, 19. and let me guide you to your Lord so that you will\nbe in awe ˹of Him˺?’” 20. Then Moses showed him the great sign,[1274] 21.\nbut he denied and disobeyed ˹Allah˺, 22. then turned his back, striving\n˹against the truth˺. 23. Then he summoned ˹his people˺ and called out, 24.\nsaying, “I am your lord, the most high!” 25. So Allah overtook him, making\nhim an example in this life and the next. 26. Surely in this is a lesson for\nwhoever stands in awe of ˹Allah˺.\nResurrection Is Easier than Creation\n27. Which is harder to create: you or the sky?[1275] He built it, 28. raising it\nhigh and forming it flawlessly. 29. He dimmed its night, and brought forth\n\n-- 531 of 694 --\n\nits daylight. 30. As for the earth, He spread it out as well,[1276] 31. bringing\nforth its water and pastures 32. and setting the mountains firmly ˹upon it˺—\n33. all as ˹a means of˺ sustenance for you and your animals.\nHorrors of Judgment Day\n34. But, when the Supreme Disaster[1277] comes to pass— 35. the Day\nevery person will remember all ˹their˺ striving, 36. and the Hellfire will be\ndisplayed for all to see— 37. then as for those who transgressed 38. and\npreferred the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world, 39. the Hellfire will certainly be\n˹their˺ home. 40. And as for those who were in awe of standing before their\nLord and restrained themselves from ˹evil˺ desires, 41. Paradise will\ncertainly be ˹their˺ home.\nThe Deniers’ Mocking Question\n42. They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?” 43.\nBut it is not for you to tell its time.[1278] 44. That knowledge rests with your\nLord ˹alone˺. 45. Your duty is only to warn whoever is in awe of it. 46. On\nthe Day they see it, it will be as if they had stayed ˹in the world˺ no more\nthan one evening or its morning.\n***\n\n-- 532 of 694 --\n\n80. He Frowned\n(’Abasa)\nIn a\nḥadîth collected by At-Tirmi\nⱬi, a blind man by the name of ’Abdullâh\nibn Um Maktûm, an early Muslim, came to the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) seeking to\nlearn more about the faith, while the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was in the middle of\na discussion with an elite Meccan pagan, trying to convince him to abandon\nhis idols and believe in the One True God. ’Abdullâh was so impatient that\nhe interrupted the discussion several times. The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) frowned\nand turned all his attention to the man he was already talking to. This\nMeccan sûrah was later revealed, telling the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) that he\nshould have tended to the faithful man who was eager to learn. After this\nsûrah was revealed, the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) would honour ’Abdullâh, calling\nhim ‘the man for whom my Lord rebuked me.’ He (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) even appointed\nhim several times as his deputy over Medina. The sûrah calls upon the\nungrateful disbelievers to reflect on how Allah produces plants out of the\nearth to realize how He can bring the dead out of their graves. The\ndescription of the horrors of the apocalypse is carried over to the next\nsûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nA Lesson to the Prophet[1279]\n1. He frowned and turned ˹his attention˺ away, 2. ˹simply˺ because the blind\nman came to him ˹interrupting˺. 3. You never know ˹O Prophet˺, perhaps he\nmay be purified, 4. or he may be mindful, benefitting from the reminder. 5.\nAs for the one who was indifferent, 6. you gave him your ˹undivided˺\nattention, 7. even though you are not to blame if he would not be purified.\n8. But as for the one who came to you, eager ˹to learn˺, 9. being in awe ˹of\nAllah˺, 10. you were inattentive to him. 11. But no! This ˹revelation˺ is truly\na reminder. 12. So let whoever wills be mindful of it. 13. It is ˹written˺ on\npages held in honour— 14. highly esteemed, purified— 15. by the hands of\nangel-scribes, 16. honourable and virtuous.\nA Reminder to Resurrection Deniers\n\n-- 533 of 694 --\n\n17. Condemned are ˹disbelieving˺ humans! How ungrateful they are ˹to\nAllah˺! 18. From what substance did He create them? 19. He created them\nfrom a sperm-drop, and ordained their development. 20. Then He makes the\nway easy for them,[1280] 21. then causes them to die and be buried.[1281] 22.\nThen when He wills, He will resurrect them. 23. But no! They have failed\nto comply with what He ordered. 24. Let people then consider their food:\n25. how We pour down rain in abundance 26. and meticulously split the\nearth open ˹for sprouts˺, 27. causing grain to grow in it, 28. as well as\ngrapes and greens, 29. and olives and palm trees, 30. and dense orchards,\n31. and fruit and fodder— 32. all as ˹a means of˺ sustenance for you and\nyour animals.\nThe Overwhelming Day\n33. Then, when the Deafening Blast[1282] comes to pass— 34. on that Day\nevery person will flee from their own siblings, 35. and ˹even˺ their mother\nand father, 36. and ˹even˺ their spouse and children. 37. For then everyone\nwill have enough concern of their own. 38. On that Day ˹some˺ faces will\nbe bright, 39. laughing and rejoicing, 40. while ˹other˺ faces will be dusty,\n41. cast in gloom— 42. those are the disbelievers, the ˹wicked˺ sinners.\n***\n\n-- 534 of 694 --\n\n81. Putting out ˹the Sun˺\n(At-Takwîr)\nThis Meccan sûrah describes some of the apocalyptic events leading up to\nthe Day of Judgment, stating that everyone will meet the consequences of\ntheir deeds. The sûrah closes by emphasizing that the Quran is Allah’s\nrevealed Word and that the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is not insane, as the pagans\nclaim.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nHorrors of the Apocalypse\n1. When the sun is put out, 2. and when the stars fall down, 3. and when the\nmountains are blown away, 4. and when pregnant camels are left untended,\n[1283] 5. and when wild beasts are gathered together,[1284] 6. and when the\nseas are set on fire,[1285] 7. and when the souls ˹and their bodies˺ are paired\n˹once more˺, 8. and when baby girls, buried alive, are asked 9. for what\ncrime they were put to death,[1286] 10. and when the records ˹of deeds˺ are\nlaid open, 11. and when the sky is stripped away, 12. and when the Hellfire\nis fiercely flared up, 13. and when Paradise is brought near— 14. ˹on that\nDay˺ each soul will know what ˹deeds˺ it has brought along.\nA Message to the Deniers\n15. I do swear by the receding stars 16. which travel and hide,[1287] 17. and\nthe night as it falls 18. and the day as it breaks![1288] 19. Indeed, this\n˹Quran˺ is the Word of ˹Allah delivered by Gabriel,˺ a noble messenger-\nangel, 20. full of power, held in honour by the Lord of the Throne, 21.\nobeyed there ˹in heaven˺, and trustworthy. 22. And your fellow man[1289] is\nnot insane. 23. And he did see that ˹angel˺ on the clear horizon,[1290] 24. and\nhe does not withhold ˹what is revealed to him of˺ the unseen. 25. And this\n˹Quran˺ is not the word of an outcast devil.[1291] 26. So what ˹other˺ path\nwould you take? 27. Surely this ˹Quran˺ is only a reminder to the whole\nworld— 28. to whoever of you wills to take the Straight Way. 29. But you\ncannot will ˹to do so˺, except by the Will of Allah, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n-- 535 of 694 --\n\n***\n\n-- 536 of 694 --\n\n82. The ˹Sky˺ Splitting Open\n(Al-Infi\nṭâr)\nLike the previous sûrah, this Meccan sûrah describes some of the horrors of\nthe Day of Judgment. The disbelievers are criticized for being ungrateful to\ntheir Creator. Everyone—including the cheaters mentioned in the next sûrah—\nwill be held accountable for their deeds, which are perfectly recorded by\nvigilant angels.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nHorrors of the Final Hour\n1. When the sky splits open, 2. and when the stars fall away, 3. and when\nthe seas burst forth, 4. and when the graves spill out, 5. ˹then˺ each soul will\nknow what it has sent forth or left behind.\nHuman Ingratitude\n6. O humanity! What has emboldened you against your Lord, the Most\nGenerous, 7. Who created you, fashioned you, and perfected your design, 8.\nmoulding you in whatever form He willed? 9. But no! In fact, you deny the\n˹final˺ Judgment, 10. while you are certainly observed by vigilant, 11.\nhonourable angels, recording ˹everything˺. 12. They know whatever you do.\nWarning of Judgment Day\n13. Indeed, the virtuous will be in bliss, 14. and the wicked will be in Hell,\n15. burning in it on Judgment Day, 16. and they will have no escape from it.\n17. What will make you realize what Judgment Day is? 18. Again, what\nwill make you realize what Judgment Day is? 19. ˹It is˺ the Day no soul will\nbe of ˹any˺ benefit to another whatsoever, for all authority on that Day\nbelongs to Allah ˹entirely˺.\n***\n\n-- 537 of 694 --\n\n83. Defrauders\n(Al-Mu\nṭaffifîn)\nThis Meccan sûrah begins with a warning to those who defraud scales\nabout the horrible Day ahead, where the wicked will be severely punished\nand the virtuous will be richly rewarded. The sûrah closes by stating that\nthe disbelievers will be paid back for making fun of the believers.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWarning to Those Who Cheat Others\n1. Woe to the defrauders! 2. Those who take full measure ˹when they buy˺\nfrom people, 3. but give less when they measure or weigh for buyers. 4. Do\nsuch people not think that they will be resurrected 5. for a tremendous Day\n— 6. the Day ˹all˺ people will stand before the Lord of all worlds?\nFate of the Wicked\n7. But no! The wicked are certainly bound for Sijjîn[1292] ˹in the depths of\nHell˺— 8. and what will make you realize what Sijjîn is?— 9. a fate\n˹already˺ sealed.[1293] 10. Woe on that Day to the deniers— 11. those who\ndeny Judgment Day! 12. None would deny it except every evildoing\ntransgressor. 13. Whenever Our revelations are recited to them, they say,\n“Ancient fables!” 14. But no! In fact, their hearts have been stained by all\n˹the evil˺ they used to commit! 15. Undoubtedly, they will be sealed off\nfrom their Lord on that Day. 16. Moreover, they will surely burn in Hell, 17.\nand then be told, “This is what you used to deny.”\nFate of the Virtuous\n18. But no! The virtuous are certainly bound for ’Illiyûn[1294] ˹in elevated\nGardens˺— 19. and what will make you realize what ’Illiyûn is?— 20. a\nfate ˹already˺ sealed, 21. witnessed by those nearest ˹to Allah˺. 22. Surely\nthe virtuous will be in bliss, 23. ˹seated˺ on ˹canopied˺ couches, gazing\naround. 24. You will recognize on their faces the glow of delight. 25. They\nwill be given a drink of sealed, pure wine, 26. whose last sip will smell like\nmusk. So let whoever aspires to this strive ˹diligently˺. 27. And this drink’s\n\n-- 538 of 694 --\n\nflavour will come from Tasnîm— 28. a spring from which those nearest ˹to\nAllah˺ will drink.\nThe Last Laugh\n29. Indeed, the wicked used to laugh at the believers, 30. wink to one\nanother whenever they passed by, 31. and muse ˹over these exploits˺ upon\nreturning to their own people. 32. And when they saw the faithful, they\nwould say, “These ˹people˺ are truly astray,” 33. even though they were not\nsent as keepers over the believers. 34. But on that Day the believers will be\nlaughing at the disbelievers, 35. as they sit on ˹canopied˺ couches, looking\non. 36. ˹The believers will be asked,˺ “Have the disbelievers ˹not˺ been paid\nback for what they used to do?”\n***\n\n-- 539 of 694 --\n\n84. The ˹Sky˺ Bursting Open\n(Al-Inshiqâq)\nAs a follow-up to the previous sûrahs, this Meccan sûrah elaborates upon\nwhat to expect on Judgment Day. The believers will receive their records of\ndeeds in their right hands and rejoice after an easy judgment, whereas the\ndisbelievers will receive their records in their left hands and cry for instant\ndestruction. The disbelievers are criticized for failing to submit to Allah,\ncontrasted with the full submission of the sky and the earth in verses 1-5.\nMore warnings to the evildoers appear in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nHorrors of Judgment Day\n1. When the sky bursts open, 2. obeying its Lord as it must, 3. and when the\nearth is flattened out, 4. and ejects ˹all˺ its contents[1295] and becomes\nempty, 5. obeying its Lord as it must, ˹surely you will all be judged˺.\nFate of the Faithful and the Wicked\n6. O humanity! Indeed, you are labouring restlessly towards your Lord, and\nwill ˹eventually˺ meet the consequences. 7. As for those who are given their\nrecord in their right hand, 8. they will have an easy reckoning, 9. and will\nreturn to their people joyfully. 10. And as for those who are given their\nrecord ˹in their left hand˺ from behind their backs, 11. they will cry for\n˹instant˺ destruction, 12. and will burn in the blazing Fire. 13. For they used\nto be prideful among their people, 14. thinking they would never return ˹to\nAllah˺. 15. Yes ˹they would˺! Surely their Lord has always been All-Seeing\nof them.\nInvitation to Believe\n16. So, I do swear by the twilight! 17. And by the night and whatever it\nenvelops! 18. And by the moon when it waxes full! 19. You will certainly\npass from one state to another.[1296] 20. So what is the matter with them that\nthey do not believe, 21. and when the Quran is recited to them, they do not\nbow down ˹in submission˺?[1297] 22. In fact, the disbelievers persist in\ndenial. 23. But Allah knows best whatever they hide. 24. So give them good\n\n-- 540 of 694 --\n\nnews of a painful punishment. 25. But those who believe and do good will\nhave a never-ending reward.\n***\n\n-- 541 of 694 --\n\n85. Constellations\n(Al-Burûj)\nThe beginning of this Meccan sûrah condemns the persecution of the\nChristians of Najrân (a city on the border of Yemen and Saudi Arabia) at\nthe hands of the pagans around 524 C.E. The tyrants are warned of the\ntorment of burning, whereas the believers are promised a great reward in\nParadise. Both this sûrah and the next swear by the towering sky,\nemphasize Allah’s infinite power, pose a warning to the evildoers, and stress\nthe divinity of the Quran.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe People of the Fire Pit\n1. By the sky full of constellations, 2. and the promised Day ˹of Judgment˺,\n3. and the witness and what is witnessed![1298] 4. Condemned are the\nmakers of the ditch— 5. the fire ˹pit˺, filled with fuel— 6. when they sat\naround it, 7. watching what they had ˹ordered to be˺ done to the believers, 8.\nwho they resented for no reason other than belief in Allah—the Almighty,\nthe Praiseworthy— 9. ˹the One˺ to Whom belongs the kingdom of the\nheavens and earth. And Allah is a Witness over all things. 10. Those who\npersecute the believing men and women and then do not repent will\ncertainly suffer the punishment of Hell and the torment of burning. 11.\nSurely those who believe and do good will have Gardens under which\nrivers flow. That is the greatest triumph.\nWarning to Arab Pagans\n12. Indeed, the ˹crushing˺ grip of your Lord is severe. 13. ˹For˺ He is\ncertainly the One Who originates and resurrects ˹all˺. 14. And He is the All-\nForgiving, All-Loving— 15. Lord of the Throne, the All-Glorious, 16. Doer\nof whatever He wills. 17. Has the story of the ˹destroyed˺ forces reached\nyou ˹O Prophet˺— 18. ˹the forces of˺ Pharaoh and Thamûd? 19. Yet the\ndisbelievers ˹still˺ persist in denial. 20. But Allah encompasses them from\nall sides. 21. In fact, this is a glorious Quran, 22. ˹recorded˺ in a Preserved\nTablet.\n\n-- 542 of 694 --\n\n***\n\n-- 543 of 694 --\n\n86. The Nightly Star\n(Aṭ-\nṬâriq)\nIn this Meccan sûrah, an oath is made that whatever a person does is\nrecorded by vigilant angels and that the Resurrection is as easy for Allah as\nthe first creation. Another oath is made that the Quran is a decisive\nmessage, and a warning is given to those who plot against Allah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Power to Create and Resurrect\n1. By the heaven and the nightly star! 2. And what will make you realize\nwhat the nightly star is? 3. ˹It is˺ the star of piercing brightness. 4. There is\nno soul without a vigilant angel ˹recording everything˺. 5. Let people then\nconsider what they were created from! 6. ˹They were˺ created from a\nspurting fluid, 7. stemming from between the backbone and the ribcage.\n[1299] 8. Surely He is fully capable of bringing them back ˹to life˺ 9. on the\nDay all secrets will be disclosed. 10. Then one will have neither power nor\n˹any˺ helper.\nWarning to Arab Pagans\n11. By the sky with its recurring cycles, 12. and the earth with its sprouting\nplants! 13. Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a decisive word, 14. and is not to be taken\nlightly. 15. They are certainly devising ˹evil˺ plans, 16. but I too am\nplanning. 17. So bear with the disbelievers ˹O Prophet˺. Let them be for\n˹just˺ a little while.\n***\n\n-- 544 of 694 --\n\n87. The Most High\n(Al-A’la)\nUnlike the wicked who plot against Allah (according to the end of the\nprevious sûrah), the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is ordered at the beginning of this\nMeccan sûrah to glorify his Lord. This fleeting world is compared to the\nshort life of plants (verses 4-5). The Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reassured of\nAllah’s support, and the wicked are warned of burning in Hell. This\nwarning is emphasized in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Master Creator\n1. Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High, 2. Who created and\n˹perfectly˺ fashioned ˹all˺, 3. and Who ordained precisely and inspired\naccordingly, 4. and Who brings forth ˹green˺ pasture, 5. then reduces it to\nwithered chaff.\nThe Quran and the Way of Ease\n6. We will have you recite ˹the Quran, O Prophet,˺ so you will not forget\n˹any of it˺, 7. unless Allah wills otherwise.[1300] He surely knows what is\nopen and what is hidden. 8. We will facilitate for you the Way of Ease.[1301]\n9. So ˹always˺ remind ˹with the Quran˺—˹even˺ if the reminder is beneficial\n˹only to some˺. 10. Those in awe ˹of Allah˺ will be mindful ˹of it˺. 11. But it\nwill be shunned by the most wretched, 12. who will burn in the greatest\nFire, 13. where they will not ˹be able to˺ live or die.\nThe Way to Success\n14. Successful indeed are those who purify themselves, 15. remember the\nName of their Lord, and pray. 16. But you ˹deniers only˺ prefer the life of\nthis world, 17. even though the Hereafter is far better and more lasting. 18.\nThis is certainly ˹mentioned˺ in the earlier Scriptures— 19. the Scriptures of\nAbraham and Moses.\n***\n\n-- 545 of 694 --\n\n88. The Overwhelming Event\n(Al-Ghâshiyah)\nThis Meccan sûrah compares the fate of the evildoers in the Hereafter to\nthat of the good-doers. Those who disbelieve in Allah’s might are criticized\nfor failing to reflect on the wonders of His creation, and are warned of the\nfate of some destroyed disbelievers mentioned at the beginning of the next\nsûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe People of Hell\n1. Has the news of the Overwhelming Event reached you ˹O Prophet˺? 2.\nOn that Day ˹some˺ faces will be downcast, 3. ˹totally˺ overburdened,\nexhausted, 4. burning in a scorching Fire, 5. left to drink from a scalding\nspring. 6. They will have no food except a foul, thorny shrub, 7. neither\nnourishing nor satisfying hunger.\nThe People of Paradise\n8. On that Day ˹other˺ faces will be glowing with bliss, 9. ˹fully˺ pleased\nwith their striving, 10. in an elevated Garden, 11. where no idle talk will be\nheard. 12. In it will be a running spring, 13. along with thrones raised high,\n14. and cups set at hand, 15. and ˹fine˺ cushions lined up, 16. and ˹splendid˺\ncarpets spread out.\nA Message to the Deniers\n17. Do they not ever reflect on camels—how they were ˹masterfully˺\ncreated;[1302] 18. and the sky—how it was raised ˹high˺; 19. and the\nmountains—how they were firmly set up; 20. and the earth—how it was\nlevelled out?[1303] 21. So, ˹continue to˺ remind ˹all, O Prophet˺, for your\nduty is only to remind. 22. You are not ˹there˺ to compel them ˹to believe˺.\n23. But whoever turns away, persisting in disbelief, 24. then Allah will\ninflict upon them the major punishment.[1304] 25. Surely to Us is their\nreturn, 26. then surely with Us is their reckoning.\n***\n\n-- 546 of 694 --\n\n89. Dawn\n(Al-Fajr)\nThe Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reassured in this Meccan sûrah that the Arab\npagans are not immune to the torments that befell ’\nȂd, Thamûd, and\nPharaoh. A reference is made to the wicked who fail to be grateful in\nprosperity and patient in adversity. The evildoers will be regretful on\nJudgment Day, whereas the righteous will be honoured. Those who\nwithhold Allah’s bounties are criticized in this sûrah (verses 17-20) and the\nnext (90:11-16).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nFate of the Deniers\n1. By the dawn,[1305] 2. and the ten nights,[1306] 3. and the even and the odd,\n4. and the night when it passes! 5. Is all this ˹not˺ a sufficient oath for those\nwho have sense? 6. Did you not see how your Lord dealt with ’Ȃd— 7. ˹the\npeople˺ of Iram—with ˹their˺ great stature, 8. unmatched in any other land;\n9. and Thamûd who carved ˹their homes into˺ the rocks in the ˹Stone˺\nValley; 10. and the Pharaoh of mighty structures?[1307] 11. They all\ntransgressed throughout the land, 12. spreading much corruption there. 13.\nSo your Lord unleashed on them a scourge of punishment.[1308] 14. ˹For˺\nyour Lord is truly vigilant.\nBad News for the Deniers\n15. Now, whenever a human being is tested by their Lord through ˹His˺\ngenerosity and blessings, they boast, “My Lord has ˹deservedly˺ honoured\nme!” 16. But when He tests them by limiting their provision, they protest,\n“My Lord has ˹undeservedly˺ humiliated me!” 17. Absolutely not! In fact,\nyou are not ˹even˺ gracious to the orphan, 18. nor do you urge one another\nto feed the poor. 19. And you devour ˹others’˺ inheritance greedily,[1309] 20.\nand love wealth fervently. 21. Enough! When the earth is entirely crushed\nover and over, 22. and your Lord comes ˹to judge˺ with angels, rank upon\nrank, 23. and Hell is brought forth on that Day—this is when every\n˹disbelieving˺ person will remember ˹their own sins˺. But what is the use of\n\n-- 547 of 694 --\n\nremembering then? 24. They will cry, “I wish I had sent forth ˹something\ngood˺ for my ˹true˺ life.” 25. On that Day He will punish ˹them˺ severely,\nlike no other, 26. and bind ˹them˺ tightly, like no other.[1310]\nGood News for the Faithful\n27. ˹Allah will say to the righteous,˺ “O tranquil soul! 28. Return to your\nLord, well pleased ˹with Him˺ and well pleasing ˹to Him˺. 29. So join My\nservants, 30. and enter My Paradise.”\n***\n\n-- 548 of 694 --\n\n90. The City\n(Al-Balad)\nThe underlying theme of this Meccan sûrah is that human beings are\nequipped with the necessary faculties to choose between right and wrong.\nThe good-doers are promised Paradise and the evildoers are promised Hell.\nThis theme is emphasized in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nUngrateful Disbelievers\n1. I do swear by this city ˹of Mecca˺— 2. even though you ˹O Prophet˺ are\nsubject to abuse in this city— 3. and by every parent and ˹their˺ child! 4.\nIndeed, We have created humankind in ˹constant˺ struggle. 5. Do they think\nthat no one has power over them, 6. boasting, “I have wasted enormous\nwealth!”? 7. Do they think that no one sees them? 8. Have We not given\nthem two eyes, 9. a tongue, and two lips; 10. and shown them the two ways\n˹of right and wrong˺?\nThe Challenging Path of Good\n11. If only they had attempted the challenging path ˹of goodness instead˺!\n12. And what will make you realize what ˹attempting˺ the challenging path\nis? 13. It is to free a slave, 14. or to give food in times of famine 15. to an\norphaned relative 16. or to a poor person in distress, 17. and—above all—to\nbe one of those who have faith and urge each other to perseverance and\nurge each other to compassion. 18. These are the people of the right. 19. As\nfor those who deny Our signs, they are the people of the left.[1311] 20. The\nFire will be sealed over them.\n***\n\n-- 549 of 694 --\n\n91. The Sun\n(Ash-Shams)\nThis Meccan sûrah states that people have free choice to purify or corrupt\ntheir souls. Those who choose purity will be successful, and those who\nchoose corruption will be destroyed like the people of Thamûd. Free choice\nis the highlight of the next sûrah as well.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nPurifying and Corrupting the Soul\n1. By the sun and its brightness, 2. and the moon as it follows it,[1312] 3. and\nthe day as it unveils it, 4. and the night as it conceals it! 5. And by heaven\nand ˹the One˺ Who built it, 6. and the earth and ˹the One˺ Who spread it! 7.\nAnd by the soul and ˹the One˺ Who fashioned it, 8. then with ˹the\nknowledge of˺ right and wrong inspired it! 9. Successful indeed is the one\nwho purifies their soul, 10. and doomed is the one who corrupts it!\nDestruction of the People of\nṢâli\nḥ\n11. Thamûd rejected ˹the truth˺ out of arrogance, 12. when the most wicked\nof them was roused ˹to kill the she-camel˺. 13. But the messenger of Allah\nwarned them, “˹Do not disturb˺ Allah’s camel and her ˹turn to˺ drink!” 14.\nStill they defied him and slaughtered her. So their Lord crushed them for\ntheir crime, levelling all to the ground.[1313] 15. He has no fear of\nconsequences.\n***\n\n-- 550 of 694 --\n\n92. The Night\n(Al-Layl)\nThis Meccan sûrah emphasizes Allah’s power to create and show the Way,\nthe people’s ability to choose between good and evil, and the consequences\nof each route. The fact that the believers will be rewarded to their\nsatisfaction is highlighted in this sûrah (verse 21) and the next (93:5).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Faithful and the Faithless\n1. By the night when it covers, 2. and the day when it shines! 3. And by ˹the\nOne˺ Who created male and female! 4. Surely the ends you strive for are\ndiverse. 5. As for the one who is charitable, mindful ˹of Allah˺, 6. and\n˹firmly˺ believes in the finest reward, 7. We will facilitate for them the Way\nof Ease. 8. And as for the one who is stingy, indifferent ˹to Allah˺, 9. and\n˹staunchly˺ denies the finest reward, 10. We will facilitate for them the path\nof hardship. 11. And their wealth will be of no benefit to them when they\ntumble ˹into Hell˺.\nReward of the Righteous and the Wicked\n12. It is certainly upon Us ˹alone˺ to show ˹the way to˺ guidance. 13. And\nsurely to Us ˹alone˺ belong this life and the next. 14. And so I have warned\nyou of a raging Fire, 15. in which none will burn except the most wretched\n— 16. who deny and turn away. 17. But the righteous will be spared from it\n— 18. who donate ˹some of˺ their wealth only to purify themselves, 19. not\nin return for someone’s favours, 20. but seeking the pleasure of their Lord,\nthe Most High. 21. They will certainly be pleased.\n***\n\n-- 551 of 694 --\n\n93. The Morning Sunlight\n(Aḍ-\nḌu\nḥa)\nIt is reported that the revelation stopped for a while after the initial sûrahs\nof the Quran, so some Meccan pagans started to mock the Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), saying that Allah has become neglectful and hateful of him\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Therefore, this Meccan sûrah was revealed to refute their false\nallegations and remind the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) of some of Allah’s favours.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nReassuring the Prophet\n1. By the morning sunlight, 2. and the night when it falls still! 3. Your Lord\n˹O Prophet˺ has not abandoned you, nor has He become hateful ˹of you˺. 4.\nAnd the next life is certainly far better for you than this one. 5. And ˹surely˺\nyour Lord will give so much to you that you will be pleased. 6. Did He not\nfind you as an orphan then sheltered you? 7. Did He not find you unguided\nthen guided you? 8. And did He not find you needy then satisfied your\nneeds? 9. So do not oppress the orphan, 10. nor repulse the beggar.[1314] 11.\nAnd proclaim the blessings of your Lord.\n***\n\n-- 552 of 694 --\n\n94. Uplifting the Heart\n(Ash-Shar\nḥ)\nLike the previous sûrah, this sûrah reminds the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) of more\nblessings to reassure him of Allah’s continued support in the city of Mecca,\nwhich is mentioned in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nMore Reassurance to the Prophet\n1. Have We not uplifted your heart for you ˹O Prophet˺, 2. relieved you of\nthe burden 3. which weighed so heavily on your back, 4. and elevated your\nrenown for you?[1315] 5. So, surely with hardship comes ease. 6. Surely with\n˹that˺ hardship comes ˹more˺ ease.[1316] 7. So once you have fulfilled ˹your\nduty˺, strive ˹in devotion˺, 8. turning to your Lord ˹alone˺ with hope.\n***\n\n-- 553 of 694 --\n\n95. The Fig\n(At-Tîn)\nThis Meccan sûrah emphasizes that Allah honours humans but many of\nthem debase themselves by denying the meeting with Him in the Hereafter.\nAbu Jahl, one of the most notorious deniers is referred to in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nReward of Ungrateful Deniers\n1. By the fig and the olive ˹of Jerusalem˺, 2. and Mount Sinai, 3. and this\nsecure city ˹of Mecca˺![1317] 4. Indeed, We created humans in the best form.\n5. But We will reduce them to the lowest of the low ˹in Hell˺, 6. except\nthose who believe and do good—they will have a never-ending reward. 7.\nNow, what makes you deny the ˹final˺ Judgment? 8. Is Allah not the most\njust of all judges?\n***\n\n-- 554 of 694 --\n\n96. The Clinging Clot ˹of Blood˺\n(Al-’Alaq)\nVerses 1-5 are known to be the first ever revealed of the Quran. The Prophet\n(\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was retreating at a cave in the outskirts of Mecca when the angel\nGabriel appeared to him, squeezing him tightly and ordering him to read.\nSince the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was unlettered, he responded, “I cannot read.”\nUltimately, Gabriel taught him: “Read in the Name of your Lord …” Some\nscholars believe that this encounter is the fulfilment of Isaiah 29:12, which\nstates, “Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying,\n‘Read this.’ And he will say, ‘I cannot read.’”[1318] The rest of the sûrah\nwas later revealed to deter Abu Jahl, a Meccan pagan elite, from abusing\nthe Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe First Revelation\n1. Read, ˹O Prophet,˺ in the Name of your Lord Who created— 2. created\nhumans from a clinging clot.[1319] 3. Read! And your Lord is the Most\nGenerous, 4. Who taught by the pen— 5. taught humanity what they knew\nnot.\nThe Man Who Abused the Prophet\n6. Most certainly, one exceeds all bounds 7. once they think they are self-\nsufficient. 8. ˹But˺ surely to your Lord is the return ˹of all˺. 9. Have you\nseen the man who prevents 10. a servant ˹of Ours˺ from praying?[1320] 11.\nWhat if this ˹servant˺ is ˹rightly˺ guided, 12. or encourages righteousness?\n13. What if that ˹man˺ persists in denial and turns away? 14. Does he not\nknow that Allah sees ˹all˺? 15. But no! If he does not desist, We will\ncertainly drag him by the forelock— 16. a lying, sinful forelock.[1321] 17.\nSo let him call his associates. 18. We will call the wardens of Hell. 19.\nAgain, no! Never obey him ˹O Prophet˺! Rather, ˹continue to˺ prostrate and\ndraw near ˹to Allah˺.\n***\n\n-- 555 of 694 --\n\n97. The Night of Glory\n(Al-Qadr)\nSince the previous sûrah commemorates the first revelation, this Meccan\nsûrah celebrates the glorious night the Quran was revealed, which is\nbelieved to be the night of Rama\nḍân 27, 610 C.E. The reason why the\nProphet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was sent with the Quran is spelled out in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Night the Quran Was Revealed\n1. Indeed, ˹it is˺ We ˹Who˺ sent this ˹Quran˺ down on the Night of Glory.\n[1322] 2. And what will make you realize what the Night of Glory is? 3. The\nNight of Glory is better than a thousand months. 4. That night the angels\nand the ˹holy˺ spirit[1323] descend, by the permission of their Lord, for every\n˹decreed˺ matter. 5. It is all peace until the break of dawn.\n***\n\n-- 556 of 694 --\n\n98. The Clear Proof\n(Al-Bayyinah)\nAccording to this Medinian sûrah, the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was sent so the\ndisbelievers may change their ways and devote their worship to Allah\nalone. Those who believe are promised a great reward, whereas those who\npersist in disbelief are warned of a horrible punishment. The judgment of\nthe believers and disbelievers is the highlight of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Prophet Is the Clear Proof\n1. The disbelievers from the People of the Book and the polytheists were\nnot going to desist ˹from disbelief˺ until the clear proof came to them: 2. a\nmessenger from Allah, reciting scrolls of ˹utmost˺ purity, 3. containing\nupright commandments. 4. It was not until this clear proof came to the\nPeople of the Book that they became divided ˹about his prophethood˺— 5.\neven though they were only commanded to worship Allah ˹alone˺ with\nsincere devotion to Him in all uprightness, establish prayer, and pay alms-\ntax. That is the upright Way.\nFate of the Deniers\n6. Indeed, those who disbelieve from the People of the Book and the\npolytheists will be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there forever. They are the\nworst of ˹all˺ beings.\nFate of the Believers\n7. Indeed, those who believe and do good—they are the best of ˹all˺ beings.\n8. Their reward with their Lord will be Gardens of Eternity, under which\nrivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and\nthey are pleased with Him. This is ˹only˺ for those in awe of their Lord.\n***\n\n-- 557 of 694 --\n\n99. The ˹Ultimate˺ Quake\n(Az-Zalzalah)\nThis Medinian sûrah states that all deeds will be brought to light and\naccounted for on Judgment Day, which is also emphasized in the next\nsûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nHorrors of Judgment Day\n1. When the earth is shaken ˹in˺ its ultimate quaking, 2. and when the earth\nthrows out ˹all˺ its contents,[1324] 3. and humanity cries, “What is wrong\nwith it?”— 4. on that Day the earth will recount everything, 5. having been\ninspired by your Lord ˹to do so˺. 6. On that Day people will proceed in\nseparate groups[1325] to be shown ˹the consequences of˺ their deeds. 7. So\nwhoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it. 8. And whoever does an\natom’s weight of evil will see it.\n***\n\n-- 558 of 694 --\n\n100. The Galloping ˹Horses˺\n(Al-’\nȂdiyât)\nThis Meccan sûrah stresses the fact that people will be accountable on\nJudgment Day for their ingratitude to their Lord. The scene of the people\nemerging from their graves (verse 9) is elaborated upon in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nHuman Ingratitude\n1. By the galloping, panting horses, 2. striking sparks of fire ˹with their\nhoofs˺, 3. launching raids at dawn, 4. stirring up ˹clouds of˺ dust, 5. and\npenetrating into the heart of enemy lines! 6. Surely humankind is ungrateful\nto their Lord— 7. and they certainly attest to this— 8. and they are truly\nextreme in their love of ˹worldly˺ gains. 9. Do they not know that when the\ncontents of the graves will be spilled out, 10. and the secrets of the hearts\nwill be laid bare— 11. surely their Lord is All-Aware of them on that Day.\n***\n\n-- 559 of 694 --\n\n101. The Striking Disaster\n(Al-Qâri’ah)\nThis Meccan sûrah describes the Resurrection and the weighing of deeds in\nthe Hereafter, followed by the final destination to either Paradise or Hell.\nThe reason why many people will end up in the Fire is given in the next\nsûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nFate of the Righteous and the Wicked\n1. The Striking Disaster! 2. What is the Striking Disaster? 3. And what will\nmake you realize what the Striking Disaster is? 4. ˹It is˺ the Day people will\nbe like scattered moths, 5. and the mountains will be like carded wool. 6. So\nas for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺, 7. they will be in a life\nof bliss. 8. And as for those whose scale is light, 9. their home will be the\nabyss. 10. And what will make you realize what that is? 11. ˹It is˺ a\nscorching Fire.\n***\n\n-- 560 of 694 --\n\n102. Competition for More ˹Gains˺\n(At-Takâthur)\nIn this Meccan sûrah and the next, the disbelievers are criticized for\nwasting their lives doing things that do not matter in the Hereafter, most\nimportantly hoarding wealth.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWasted Lives\n1. Competition for more ˹gains˺ diverts you ˹from Allah˺, 2. until you end\nup in ˹your˺ graves.[1326] 3. But no! You will soon come to know. 4. Again,\nno! You will soon come to know. 5. Indeed, if you were to know ˹your fate˺\nwith certainty, ˹you would have acted differently˺. 6. ˹But˺ you will surely\nsee the Hellfire. 7. Again, you will surely see it with the eye of certainty. 8.\nThen, on that Day, you will definitely be questioned about ˹your worldly˺\npleasures.\n***\n\n-- 561 of 694 --\n\n103. The ˹Passage of˺ Time\n(Al-’A\nṣr)\nThis Meccan sûrah emphasizes that, unlike the evildoers mentioned in the\nnext sûrah, only those who take advantage of this fleeting life by doing good\nwill be successful in the eternal life to come.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWake-up Call to Humanity\n1. By the ˹passage of˺ time! 2. Surely humanity is in ˹grave˺ loss, 3. except\nthose who have faith, do good, and urge each other to the truth, and urge\neach other to perseverance.\n***\n\n-- 562 of 694 --\n\n104. The Backbiters\n(Al-Humazah)\nThis Meccan sûrah is critical of those who slander others and withhold\nAllah’s bounties. It is made clear that their punishment in Hell is as easy for\nAllah as the destruction of the evil force mentioned in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nWarning to Defamers\n1. Woe to every backbiter, slanderer, 2. who amasses wealth ˹greedily˺ and\ncounts it ˹repeatedly˺, 3. thinking that their wealth will make them\nimmortal! 4. Not at all! Such a person will certainly be tossed into the\nCrusher. 5. And what will make you realize what the Crusher is? 6. ˹It is˺\nAllah’s kindled Fire, 7. which rages over the hearts. 8. It will be sealed over\nthem, 9. ˹tightly secured˺ with long braces.[1327]\n***\n\n-- 563 of 694 --\n\n105. The Elephant\n(Al-Fîl)\nThis Meccan sûrah recounts the story of Abraha Al-\nḤabashi (lit., the\nAbyssinian), who led a large army of men and elephants to demolish the\nKa’bah in 570 C.E. so pilgrims would visit the cathedral he had built in Yemen\ninstead. However, the army was destroyed before reaching Mecca. It is\ncommonly believed that the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was born the same year.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Protection of the Ka’bah\n1. Have you not seen ˹O Prophet˺ how your Lord dealt with the Army of the\nElephant? 2. Did He not frustrate their scheme? 3. For He sent against them\nflocks of birds, 4. that pelted them with stones of baked clay, 5. leaving\nthem like chewed up straw.[1328]\n***\n\n-- 564 of 694 --\n\n106. ˹The People of˺ Quraysh\n(Quraysh)\nThis Meccan sûrah is viewed as a continuation of the previous one. The\ngeneral idea is that the Meccan pagans must be grateful and devoted to\nAllah alone for saving the Ka’bah from the Army of the Elephant. Those\nwho are unfaithful to Allah and unkind to the helpless are criticized in the\nnext sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Major Favour to the Meccans[1329]\n1. ˹At least˺ for ˹the favour of˺ making Quraysh habitually secure— 2.\nsecure in their trading caravan ˹to Yemen˺ in the winter and ˹Syria˺ in the\nsummer— 3. let them worship the Lord of this ˹Sacred˺ House, 4. Who has\nfed them against hunger and made them secure against fear.[1330]\n***\n\n-- 565 of 694 --\n\n107. ˹Simplest˺ Aid\n(Al-Mâ’ûn)\nThis Meccan sûrah, which takes its name from verse 7, condemns the\ndeniers of the Hereafter for their lack of devotion to Allah and lack of\ncompassion towards the needy. In the next sûrah, the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is\nordered to be devoted to Allah alone and share the meat of his sacrificial\nanimals with those in need.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nQualities of Judgment Deniers\n1. Have you seen the one who denies the ˹final˺ Judgment? 2. That is the\none who repulses the orphan, 3. and does not encourage the feeding of the\npoor. 4. So woe to those ˹hypocrites˺ who pray 5. yet are unmindful of their\nprayers; 6. those who ˹only˺ show off, 7. and refuse to give ˹even the\nsimplest˺ aid.[1331]\n***\n\n-- 566 of 694 --\n\n108. Abundant Goodness\n(Al-Kawthar)\nThis Meccan sûrah was revealed to reassure the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Since\nthe Prophet’s sons died in childhood, Al-’\nȂṣ ibn Wâ'il, an infamous Meccan\npagan, used to say that Mu\nḥammad (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) would be forgotten because\nhe had no son to carry his name. Today, ‘Mu\nḥammad’ is the most common\nname in the world, whereas the name of Al-’\nȂṣ is barely mentioned. The\nProphet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is ordered to be devoted to Allah alone, which is the\nunderlying theme of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nGood News to the Prophet\n1. Indeed, We have granted you ˹O Prophet˺ abundant goodness.[1332] 2. So\npray and sacrifice to your Lord ˹alone˺. 3. Only the one who hates you is\ntruly cut off ˹from any goodness˺.\n***\n\n-- 567 of 694 --\n\n109. The Disbelievers\n(Al-Kâfirûn)\nIt is reported that the pagans offered to worship Allah alone for one year,\nprovided that the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) worshipped their multiple gods for a\nyear. So this Meccan sûrah was revealed, telling them that he (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) will\nbe dedicated only to the worship of Allah until the last breath of his life,\nwhich is the highlight of the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nNo Compromise in Worshipping Allah\n1. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O you disbelievers! 2. I do not worship what you\nworship, 3. nor do you worship what I worship. 4. I will never worship\nwhat you worship, 5. nor will you ever worship what I worship. 6. You have\nyour way, and I have my Way.”\n***\n\n-- 568 of 694 --\n\n110. The ˹Ultimate˺ Help\n(An-Na\nṣr)\nThis Medinian sûrah was revealed close to the end of the Prophet’s life,\ninstructing him that once his mission is complete and his message is\nembraced by many, he (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) should be ready to meet his Creator. A\ndeterring example of those who rejected his message is given in the next\nsûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nNearing the Journey’s End\n1. When Allah’s ˹ultimate˺ help comes and the victory ˹over Mecca is\nachieved˺, 2. and you ˹O Prophet˺ see the people embracing Allah’s Way in\ncrowds, 3. then glorify the praises of your Lord and seek His forgiveness,\nfor certainly He is ever Accepting of Repentance.\n***\n\n-- 569 of 694 --\n\n111. The Palm-Fibre Rope\n(Al-Masad)\nThis Meccan sûrah is a warning to Abu Lahab (lit., the Father of Flames),\nwho was an uncle of the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Both Abu Lahab and his wife\nUm Jamîl used to abuse the Prophet (\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and deny the One True God,\nWho is described in the next sûrah.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nThe Fate of an Evil Couple\n1. May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and he ˹himself˺ perish! 2. Neither\nhis wealth nor ˹worldly˺ gains will benefit him. 3. He will burn in a flaming\nFire, 4. and ˹so will˺ his wife, the carrier of ˹thorny˺ kindling,[1333] 5. around\nher neck will be a rope of palm-fibre.[1334]\n***\n\n-- 570 of 694 --\n\n112. Purity of Faith\n(Al-Ikhlâ\nṣ)\nThis Meccan sûrah refutes the Trinity, idolatry, atheism, and polytheism and\ncalls for full devotion to the only True God, Who is worthy to be worshipped\nand Whose protection is to be sought, according to the next two sûrahs.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nAllah’s Absolute Oneness\n1. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He is Allah—One ˹and Indivisible˺; 2. Allah—the\nSustainer ˹needed by all˺. 3. He has never had offspring, nor was He born.\n4. And there is none comparable to Him.”[1335]\n***\n\n-- 571 of 694 --\n\n113. The Daybreak\n(Al-Falaq)\nThis Medinian sûrah is recited as a supplication to the Almighty against\nany kind of evil.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nSeeking Protection Against All Evil\n1. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak 2. from the\nevil of whatever He has created, 3. and from the evil of the night when it\ngrows dark, 4. and from the evil of those ˹witches casting spells by˺\nblowing onto knots, 5. and from the evil of an envier when they envy.”\n***\n\n-- 572 of 694 --\n\n114. Humankind\n(An-Nâs)\nLike the previous sûrah, this Medinian sûrah is a supplication against the\nevil of humans and jinn. This final sûrah emphasizes the fact that Allah is\nthe Lord and Master of all and that He is the only One to be called upon for\nhelp, which connects full circle with the central theme of the first sûrah of\nthe Quran.\nIn the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful\nSeeking Protection Against Evil Whispers\n1. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I seek refuge in the Lord of humankind, 2. the Master\nof humankind, 3. the God of humankind, 4. from the evil of the lurking\nwhisperer— 5. who whispers into the hearts of humankind— 6. from\namong jinn and humankind.”\n\n-- 573 of 694 --\n\nTHEMATIC INDEXT\n۩ DOCTRINE\nBasic tenets: Faith perfected 5:3;

Islam is neither named\nafter a person or a tribe nor does it end with an –ism. Though each prophet\nhad a relatively different law, the essence of the message of Islam was\nalways the same: have faith in one God and do good. In the Bible, the first\nfour of the Ten Commandments enjoin the worship of one God; the rest\nurge believers to avoid what is wrong and to do what is good. All prophets\nand their followers (including Jesus and his disciples) are simply called\n“Muslims” in the Quran. Hence, anyone who submits to Allah and strives to\nbe a good person can be called a ‘muslim’ (with a small ‘m’) from a\nlinguistic perspective.\nEvery human being is born with the innate will (fi\nṭrah) to submit to\nAllah, but parents and society change this nature, and in order to relate to\nthe Almighty, many have put a face on God (mostly human or animal)\nthroughout history. The process of restoring the fi\nṭrah is called reversion.\nIslam is not only a religion, but a comprehensive way of life. Based on\ncommon sense and clear-cut teachings, Islam defines the rights and\nresponsibilities of every individual in regards to their relationship with\nAllah and His creation. It balances the spiritual and material needs of its\nfollowers and helps them gain happiness in this life and salvation in the\nnext.\nWho Is a Muslim?\nA ‘Muslim’ (with a capital ‘M’) is someone who practices Islam. Muslims\nfollow the five pillars of Islam:\n-Shahâdah, testifying that there is only One God and Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nis His last Prophet\n-\nṢalâh, praying five times a day\n-\nṢawm, fasting from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramaḍân\n\n-- 588 of 694 --\n\n-Zakâh, paying alms-tax on savings worth 85 g of gold or more, if the\namount is kept for a year\n-\nḤajj, performing pilgrimage to Mecca, if physically and financially able\nto.\nMuslims also believe in the six articles of faith:\n-Almighty Allah\n-His angels\n-His prophets\n-His scriptures\n-Free choice, fate, and destiny\n-The Day of Judgment\nIslam is the fastest growing religion in the world. Totalling 1.6 billion,\nMuslims make up one-quarter of the world’s population. Muslims come\nfrom different ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds. Contrary to the\ncommon belief, not all Muslims are Arab; not all Arabs are Muslim. Arabs\nmake up less than 18% of the world’s Muslim population. Indonesia (a\nsingle non-Arab Muslim country in Southeast Asia) has more Muslims than\nall Arab countries combined.\nIslam should not be judged by what any Muslim does, but Muslims\nshould be judged based on what Islam teaches. Islam is perfect; Muslims\nare not.\nWho Is Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)?\nThe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was born in Mecca in the year 570 C.E. His father\ndied before his birth and his mother died when he was six years old. As he\ngrew up, he acquired the epithet ‘the trustworthy.’ Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nhad long detested the idolatry, social injustice, and corruption found in\nsociety. At the age of forty, he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received the first revelation of the\nQuran from Allah through the angel Gabriel. Since the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\ncould not read or write, he had scribes write down passages over the course\nof their revelation. The Quran was also memorized word for word by the\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and many of his companions. Although the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) performed many miracles, such as the splitting of the moon (see\n\n-- 589 of 694 --\n\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n54:1), water gushing out from between his fingers, multiplying food, still\nthe Quran is his greatest miracle.\nJust like many previous prophets, Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his early\nfollowers were persecuted—and some were even killed—for advocating\nrevolutionary ideas such as social justice and women’s rights. As the\npersecution grew fierce, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and many of his companions\nemigrated to the city of Medina, 260 miles to the north of Mecca. This\nemigration (Hijrah) marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. After\nseveral years, Mecca ultimately surrendered peacefully to Muḥammad\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) who issued a universal amnesty.\nBefore the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) passed away at the age of sixty-three, the\ngreater part of the Arabian Peninsula had become Muslim, and within a\ncentury of his death, Islam had spread to Spain in the west and as far east as\nChina. The rapid spread of Islam (especially to territories previously\noccupied by the Byzantine and Persian empires) was mostly because of its\nsimple teachings and social justice.\nWhy Do Muslims Call God ‘Allah’?\nArab Muslims, Christians, and Jews call God ‘Allah.’ The word ‘Allah’ is\nunique in the sense that it has no plural or gender. It literally means in\nArabic “the One, True God.” Allah has many attributes and beautiful names\nsuch as the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, the All-Loving, the\nJudge, the Creator, and the Provider. In his native tongue of Aramaic, Jesus\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) used Alaha to refer to Allah. Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) used, among other\nthings, Eloh in Hebrew. Allah, Alaha, and Eloh come from three Semitic\nlanguages: Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew respectively.\nWhat Is the Quran?\nThe Quran is the holy book of Islam. It is a collection of revelations that\nwere received by the Prophet Muhammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) over the course of\ntwenty-three years in the 7th century C.E. There is only one version of the\nQuran, perfectly preserved in written and oral records around the world for\nnearly 1400 years.\nThe Quran is the only book in history that has been memorized\nverbatim by millions of people. Sûrahs were written down separately during\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n\n-- 590 of 694 --\n\nthe life of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and were collected in one volume within\ntwo years of his death. Exact copies were later duplicated from the original\ncollection during the reign of the 3rd Caliph, ’Uthmân ibn ’Affân, and sent\nto major Muslim cities. Today, all copies of the Quran (called ma\nṣâḥif,\nplural of mu\nṣḥaf) are perfect duplicates of the original.\nThe Quran emphasizes universal ethics such as honesty, sincerity,\ngenerosity, mercy, and standing up for what is right. It aims at humanizing\nhumanity and deifying Allah and therefore condemns those who personify\nAllah and idolize their fellow created beings.\nWas the Quran Copied from the Bible?\nIt is worth mentioning that the first Arabic translation of the Bible was done\ncenturies after the Prophet’s death. From an Islamic point of view,\nsimilarities between the Quran and the Bible (especially historical stories\nsuch as that of Joseph, Moses, and Jesus) stem from the fact that both\nscriptures came originally from the same source—divine revelation.\nBecause of differences in transmission and interpretation of the Bible,\nover time the stories changed. The Quranic narratives now appear slightly\ndifferent, for example, unlike the Quran (20:120-122), in the book of\nGenesis, Eve was tempted to eat from the tree and therefore she is to blame\nfor the Fall. Also, according to the Quran (Sûrah 19), prophets are infallible\nof sin. But in the Bible, some prophets are guilty of shameful and even\ncriminal acts. For example, David impregnated his neighbour’s wife\n(Bathsheba) before conspiring to get her husband (Uriah) killed (II Samuel\n11:1-27), Lot had sex with his two daughters (Genesis 19:30-38), and Noah\ngot drunk and naked (Genesis 9:20-21).\nSome Biblical stories are not in the Quran and vice versa. For\nexample, the Biblical story of Isaiah is not in the Quran, while the story of\nMoses and Al-Khaḍir mentioned in Sûrah 18 of the Quran is not in the\nBible. Also, there are three miracles of Jesus in the Quran that are not in the\nBible (see 5:110-115).\nAlthough both scriptures emphasize global ethics (such as dignity,\nkindness, and charity), each revolves around a different theology. Both have\n\n-- 591 of 694 --\n\ncontrasting views on the perception of Allah, Jesus, salvation, crucifixion,\nand the original sin.\nIs Islam Compatible with Science?\nAlthough the Quran is a book of signs, not a book of science, there are\nmany scientific references in the Quran such as the formation and\ndevelopmental phases of an embryo in the uterus (23:12–14 and 22:5), the\nBig Bang (21:30), the constant expansion of the universe (51:47–8),\nspherical shape of the earth (39:5 and 79:30), the earth’s rotation (27:88),\nand many others that have become known only in the last two centuries.\nAccording to an Arab proverb, “The ink of a scholar is holier than the\nblood of a martyr.” Islam’s emphasis on education galvanized learning and\nscience in the Muslim world culminating in what is known as the Islamic\nGolden Age. For centuries, Muslims pioneered medicine, anatomy,\nmathematics, geography, astronomy, architecture, and many other sciences.\nAlgebra, alchemy, and alcohol are all Arabic words. The Canon of\nMedicine by Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037 C.E.) was a primary medical\ntext in medieval Europe for more than 700 years. Many surgical tools that\nare in use today were invented by Albucasis (Alzahrâwi, 936-1013 C.E.).\nMariam Al-Astrolabiya, a female Muslim scholar who lived in the 10th\ncentury in Syria, was famous for designing and constructing astrolabes.\nArabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) are used worldwide.\nMuslims invented numerous sciences and developed many others\n(which they had inherited from the Romans, Greeks, Persians, Indians, and\nothers) and laid the foundations to the European industrial revolution. The\ninvention of cameras, computers, and navigation systems could not have\nbeen possible without the contributions of Muslim scholars.\nWhat Is Sharia Law?\nLinguistically, Sharia means a pathway. Technically, it is the Muslim law,\nderived mainly from the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muḥammad\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), governing every aspect of a Muslim’s life. Sharia is made up of\nthousands of teachings and rulings covering theology, acts of worship,\nmanners, human interactions, business transactions, family relations\n\n-- 592 of 694 --\n\n(marriage, divorce, inheritance, etc.), war and peace, belief in the unseen\n(Allah, angels, and the Hereafter), and criminal law.\nSharia mainly aims at protecting 5 things: 1) Life 2) Honour 3)\nFreedom to practice one’s faith 4) Intellect 5) Property. Therefore, there are\npunishments in Islamic Law for violating any of these rights. Every country\nhas punishments for offences—even though the penalty for the same crime\nmay vary from one country to another. To say that Sharia is all about\nchopping people’s hands off is like saying that the American law is all\nabout killing people with the electric chair! Sharia does not apply to non-\nMuslim minorities living in predominantly Muslim countries. Of the fifty-\nseven Muslim countries in the world, the great majority are secular, not\nSharia-based.\nMuslims living in the West follow the law of the land and maintain\nSharia mainly in personal matters (such as prayers, marriage, and\ninheritance). Sharia also forbids the consumption of pork, alcohol, and\ndrugs. Smoking is frowned upon.\nIs Islam Compatible with Modern Democracy?\nWe have to make the distinction between what Islam teaches and how\ncountries in the Muslim world are run. As pointed out earlier, many Muslim\ncountries are secular-based, not fully subscribing to Islamic morals or\nwestern democratic values. Islam and modern democracies have many\nthings in common. For example, the fundamental principles in the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights are acceptable Islamically. What\nmakes Islamic values unique is that they do not change over time, what is\nright in the sight of Allah is always right and what is wrong is always\nwrong. On the other hand, many secular freedoms (which have been mostly\nadopted in the last few decades) are still subject to debate in western\nsocieties. For example, marijuana, same-sex marriage, abortion, incest, and\nprostitution are legal in some democracies and illegal in some others. The\nsame applies to euthanasia and the death penalty. Moreover, in a secular\nsociety, the majority’s opinion prevails. In the Islamic concept of shûra, the\ntruth prevails even if it is held by a minority. For example, the segregation\nof blacks and whites under the Jim Crow Laws would be prohibited under\nSharia, since discrimination based on colour goes against Islamic beliefs.\n\n-- 593 of 694 --\n\nDoes Jihad Equal Terrorism?\nLife is sacred in Islam. The Quran (5:32) states, “Whoever takes a life …, it\nwill be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be\nas if they saved all of humanity.” Those who manipulate verses from the\nQuran by taking them out of context to justify violence against innocents\ncontradict the Quran’s call for tolerance and peaceful co-existence. Islam is\nunequivocally against terrorism (see 5:33).\nJihad means to strive for a better, more righteous life. The major jihad\nis to overcome one’s desires (such as greed). Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nsays, “The highest form of jihad is to speak a word of truth in the presence\nof a tyrant,” “Kindness to parents is a form of jihad,” and “Charity to\norphans and widows is jihad.” The minor jihad is fighting in self-defence.\nThe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) set the etiquettes of fighting as follows: “Do not ask\nAllah to meet your enemies in battle” and “Do not start a war. If you must\nfight, then strike only at those ˹combatants˺ who attacked you. Do not attack\nwomen, children, the elderly, or those retreating in their places of worship.\nDo not cut down trees or kill animals.”\nWe have to keep in mind that all violent passages in the Quran\n(including verses in sûrahs 2, 8, 9, 47, and 48) strictly concern conflicts\nbetween early Muslims and the pagans of Mecca over 1400 years ago. As\nsuch, all passages should be understood in their historical context. In Islam,\nfighting is allowed against aggressors regardless of their faith. Fighting\nagainst innocents is prohibited regardless of their faith. Overall, violent\npassages in the Quran talk about one of three things:\n-Fighting back in self-defence.\n-Making peace if attackers cease.\n-Or resuming the fight if a truce is violated.\nWhat is the Origin of Religious Violence?\nNo religion condones the killing of innocents, but some people manipulate\nreligion to justify acts of violence. So, even if Islam and other faiths have\nnever existed, humans would have come up with other excuses to fight for\ndomination. We have seen notorious anti-religion, secularist ideologies, like\nthose championed by Mao and Stalin (the top mass murderers in modern\n\n-- 594 of 694 --\n\nhistory), which were responsible for over seventy million deaths in the 20th\ncentury.\nMost victims of violence in the Muslim world are Muslims, who are\neither killed by unjustified wars, suicide bombs, or drone attacks. Over the\nlast few decades, hundreds of thousands have been killed—most of them\ncivilians—and many others wounded or displaced. Justice, dignity, and\neducation, some of the most fundamental aspects of human rights, are the\nkey to peace and prosperity anywhere in the world.\nAre Women Abused in Islam?\nThe Quran makes it clear that men and women are equal before Allah and\nthe Law (16:97 and 33:35). Abuses against some Muslim women (e.g.,\nhonour killing and forced marriages) are cultural practices in some Muslim\ncountries that contradict Islamic teachings.\nThere are many prominent Muslim women in every field: education,\nscience, business, etc. Several Muslim women have been elected president\nand prime minister in Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia, Pakistan,\nBangladesh, and Turkey. The high status of women in Islam explains why\n75% of reverts to Islam are women.\nWhy Do Muslim Women Wear the Hijab?\nThe veil is deeply rooted in all Abrahamic traditions. Christian icons such\nas Mary and Mother Teresa are always depicted with veils. In the Quran and\nthe teachings of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), both men and women are urged to be\nmodest in their dress and behaviour. Hijab is worn by adult Muslim women\nin the presence of adult males outside of their immediate family.\nWhat Are the Rights of Non-Muslims in Islam?\nIslam guarantees the freedom of non-Muslims to practice their faith and\nprotection for their places of worship. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said, “Whoever\nharms a non-Muslim under the protection of Islam, I shall be their opponent\non Judgment Day and they will not even smell Paradise.” The Quran\nteaches that there are three types of brotherhood: brotherhood in humanity\n(this includes all human beings), biological brotherhood (one’s siblings),\nand brotherhood in faith (fellow Muslims).\n\n-- 595 of 694 --\n\nIslam allows giving charity to non-Muslims and exchanging gifts and\nvisits with them. The Quran (60:8-9) exhorts Muslims to be kind and\ngenerous to non-Muslims. It forbids forcing non-Muslims to convert to\nIslam (2:256). For centuries, non-Muslim communities thrived under\nMuslim rule. Many Christians and Jews occupied prominent positions in the\ncourts of some Muslim caliphs, serving as translators, physicians, and\narchitects.\nDo Muslims Believe in Other Prophets?\nThe Quran mentions twenty-five prophets by name—of whom five are\ngiven the honorary title of ‘the Messengers of Firm Resolve,’ namely\nAbraham, Noah, Moses, Jesus, and Muḥammad. The Quran (12:111) says,\n“In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason.” Some of the\nmost common names in the Muslim world include ’Îsa (Jesus in Arabic),\nMûsa (Moses), Mariam (Mary), Yûsuf (Joseph), and Ibrâhîm (Abraham).\nJesus is mentioned by name in the Quran twenty-five times, Mary thirty-\none times (compared to eighteen times in the Bible), whereas Prophet\nMuḥammad is mentioned by name only four times. Sûrah 19 of the Quran\nis named after Mary. Muslims believe that Jesus is the Christ and the\nMessiah. They also believe in his virgin birth, ascension, and second\ncoming.\nBelow is a list of all the prophets mentioned by name in the Quran, each\nfollowed by transliteration of the corresponding Arabic name:\n1. Aaron … Hârûn\n2. Abraham … Ibrâhîm\n3. Adam … Âdam\n4. David … Dâwûd\n5. Elias … Ilyâs\n6. Elisha … Al-Yasa’\n7. Enoch … Idrîs\n8. Hûd … Hûd\n9. Isaac … Is\nḥâq\n10. Ishmael … Ismâ’îl\n11. Jacob … Ya’qûb\n12. Jesus …’Îsa\n\n-- 596 of 694 --\n\n13. Job … Aiyûb\n14. John the Baptist … Ya\nḥya\n15. Jonah … Yûnus\n16. Joseph … Yûsuf\n17. Lot … Lû\nṭ\n18. Moses … Mûsa\n19. Muḥammad … Mu\nḥammad\n20. Noah … Nû\nḥ\n21. Ṣâliḥ …\nṢâli\nḥ\n22. Shu’aib … Shu’aib\n23. Solomon … Sulaimân\n24. Zachariah … Zakariya\n25. Ⱬul-Kifl …\nⱫul-Kifl\nAs the Quran teaches Muslims not to exalt one prophet over others (2:285),\nit is customary to say ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص ) “peace be upon him” when the name of\nany of the prophets is mentioned.\n***\n\n-- 597 of 694 --\n\nSELECT TEACHINGS OF THE PROPHET MUḤAMMAD\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nOn the Environment and Animal Rights\n“If Judgment Day arrives and you have a seedling in your hand, plant it\nregardless” and “Don’t waste water even if you live by a river.” The\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) prohibited polluting water sources and promised a\nheavenly reward for planting trees to feed animals, birds, and humans. He\ntaught that a good deed done to an animal is like a good deed done to a\nhuman being, while an act of cruelty to an animal is as bad as cruelty to a\nhuman being. He prohibited the use of live birds and animals as a target for\narrows, the killing of animals for sport, slaughtering an animal in front of\nother animals, and forbade overburdening animals and underfeeding them.\nOn the Treatment of Others\nThe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said that smiling is a charity and taught: “They are\nnot of us, those who do not show respect to our seniors or show mercy to\nour youngsters.” He gave women the right to inheritance, education, to own\nproperty, and have a say in marriage and said, “The best among the\nbelievers are those who are best to their wives,” and that Paradise lies under\nthe feet of the mother.\nHe (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received Christians in his mosque and allowed them to\npray there when the time for their prayers came. He also commemorated the\nday Moses and the Children of Israel were saved from Pharaoh and his\narmy by fasting and ordering Muslims to fast—a practice that has continued\nuntil today.\nHe (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said, “O humanity! Your Lord is one and your ancestry\n[i.e., Adam and Eve] is one. No Arab is superior to a non-Arab and no non-\nArab is superior to an Arab, nor is any white superior to any black or any\nblack superior to any white except on account of their piety,” and “None of\nyou truly believes until they love for others what they love for themselves.”\nOn the Best Way of Life\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n\n-- 598 of 694 --\n\nThe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) set out a way of life through his own example, but he\nalso had the following to say on living a fulfilling life. “The ˹true˺ Muslim\nis the one who does not harm people with his hands or tongue.” “Seeking\nknowledge is an obligation on every Muslim.” “Don’t respond to evil by\nevil, but by doing what is good.” “Show mercy to those on earth and Allah\nwill show mercy to you.”\n“Take advantage of five matters before the coming of five things: your\nhealth before you fall sick, your wealth before you become poor, your free\ntime before you become busy, your youth before you become old, and your\nlife before your death.”\n“Be mindful of Allah and He will always be with you. Remember\nAllah in times of prosperity and He will remember you in times of\nadversity. And know that what has passed you by [and you have failed to\nattain] was not going to befall you, and what has befallen you was not going\nto pass you by. And know that victory comes with perseverance, relief with\naffliction, and ease with hardship.”\n***\n\n-- 599 of 694 --\n\nWHAT THEY SAID ABOUT MUḤAMMAD (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\n“My choice of Muḥammad to lead the list of the world's most influential\npersons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he\nwas the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the\nreligious and secular levels.”\n--Michael H. Hart, The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential\nPersons in History, New York, 1978, p. 33.\n“In all things Muḥammad was profoundly practical. When his beloved son\nIbrahim died, an eclipse occurred, and rumours of God's personal\ncondolence quickly arose. Whereupon Muḥammad announced, ‘An eclipse\nis a phenomenon of nature. It is foolish to attribute such things to the death\nor birth of a human being.’”\n--James A. Michener, “Islam: The Misunderstood Religion,” in\nReader’s Digest, May 1955.\n“I have studied Muḥammad–the wonderful man, and in my opinion, he\nmust be called the Savior of Humanity. I believe that if a man like him were\nto assume the leadership of the modern world, he would succeed in solving\nits problems in a way that would bring it much needed peace and\nhappiness.”\n--George Bernard Shaw, The Genuine Islam, Singapore, Vol. 1, No.\n8, 1936.\n“I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a\nplace for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid\nsimplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the scrupulous regard\nfor pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity,\nhis fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission. These and\nnot the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every\nobstacle.”\n--Mahatma Gandhi, Young India, 1924.\n\n-- 600 of 694 --\n\n***\n\n-- 601 of 694 --\n\nENDNOTES\n[1] i.e., Lord of everything in existence including angels, humans, and\nanimals.\n[2] It is customary to say “Âmîn” or “Amen” at the end of this sûrah.\n[3] See Stylistic Features for information about these letters.\n[4] i.e., there is no doubt regarding its authenticity or consistency.\n[5] The word muttaqi (plural muttaqûn) can be translated as one who is\nmindful ˹of Allah˺, devout, pious, God-fearing, righteous, or God-\nconscious.\n[6] i.e., the belief in Allah, the angels, and the Day of Judgment.\n[7] See Notes on Translation for information about the use of ˹O Prophet˺.\n[8] When they were criticized for their close association with the pagans who\nwere hostile to Muslims, they would argue that they only wanted to make\npeace between Muslims and their enemies.\n[9] Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[10] Residents of Paradise will be in a perfect condition. There will be neither\nphysical impurities such as illness, urination, defecation, or menstruation;\nnor spiritual blemishes such as jealousy, envy, or hatred.\n[11] Allah knew that there would be many righteous people who would do\ngood, make peace, and stand up for justice. Since humans have free\nchoice, whoever chooses to believe and do good is better in the sight of\nAllah than all other beings, and whoever chooses to disbelieve and do evil\nis worse than all other beings. See 98:6-8.\n[12] If you are true that Allah will never create anyone who is more\nhonourable and knowledgeable than you.\n[13] Prostration in this verse does not mean worship, but an act of respect. A\nsimilar occurrence can be found in Sûrah 12, where Jacob (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), his\nwife, and his eleven children knelt down before Joseph (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[14] Iblîs was the name of Satan before his fall from grace. Iblîs was not an\nangel, but one of the jinn (see 18:50). Jinn are another creation of Allah,\n\n-- 602 of 694 --\n\nsimilar to humans in that they—unlike angels—have free will, but are\nmade of smokeless fire and live in another plane of existence.\n[15] The command to prostrate was a test of obedience. Satan arrogantly\nrefused to comply because he believed he was superior to Adam—arguing\nthat Adam was made of mud while Satan was made of fire (see 7:12).\n[16] Both Adam and Eve were deceived, both sinned, and both were later\nforgiven. There is no concept of original sin in Islam.\n[17] i.e., humans and Satan.\n[18] The prayer that Adam and Eve were inspired to say is mentioned in 7:23,\n“Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have\nmercy on us, we will certainly be losers.”\n[19] Israel is another name for Prophet Jacob.\n[20] This refers to the passages in the Torah and the Gospel that call for the\nworship of the One True God, doing what is good, and avoiding what is\nevil.\n[21] Trading Allah’s revelations for a fleeting gain is a recurring theme in the\nfirst few sûrahs of the Quran. This refers to the practice of some Jewish\nauthorities in Medina who contradicted certain rulings in the Torah by\ngiving people lenient opinions only to please them in exchange for money.\n[22] The alms-tax (zakâh) is the payment of 2.5% of someone’s savings only\nif the amount is equivalent to or greater than 85 g of gold, if that amount\nremains untouched for a whole Islamic year—around 355 days.\n[23] Meaning, I chose you above all peoples of your time.\n[24] “Intercession” is the act of pleading with Allah on behalf of another\nperson on the Day of Judgment.\n[25] Manna (heavenly bread) and quails (chicken-like birds) sustained the\nchildren of Israel in the wilderness after they left Egypt.\n[26] The Sabians are an indigenous group that believes in a supreme being\nand lives mostly in Iraq.\n[27] This verse should be understood in light of 3:19 and 3:85. For more\ndetails, see the Introduction.\n[28] Although many scholars believe that these individuals were turned into\nreal apes, others interpret this verse in a metaphorical sense. This style is\n\n-- 603 of 694 --\n\nnot uncommon in the Quran. See 62:5 regarding the donkey that carries\nbooks and 2:18 regarding the deaf, dumb, and blind.\n[29] This sûrah is named after the cow in this story, which happened at the\ntime of Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). A rich man was killed by his nephew, his only\nheir, and the body was thrown at the door of an innocent man. After a long\ninvestigation, no one was identified as the killer. Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) prayed\nfor guidance and was told that the only way to find the killer was to\nsacrifice a cow and strike the victim with a piece of it. When this was\ndone, the victim spoke miraculously and said who the killer was.\n[30] i.e., verses prophesizing the coming of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the Torah\n(including Deuteronomy 18:15-18 and 33:2).\n[31] i.e., warning of a curse or punishment.\n[32] The indigenous people of Medina were divided into two warring groups:\nAl-Aws and Al-Khazraj. Some Jewish tribes were allied with the former\nand others with the latter, which meant that in times of war each of these\nJewish tribes had to fight along with their allies against their enemies,\nincluding other Jews. When the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) migrated to Medina, he\nbrought about a lasting peace in the city.\n[33] The holy spirit is Gabriel, a mighty angel created from light, whose main\nduty is to communicate Allah’s messages to prophets.\n[34] Their hearts are unreceptive because they claim they have enough\nknowledge already.\n[35] lit., the disbelievers.\n[36] i.e., the Quran.\n[37] i.e., disobeying Allah, killing some of the prophets (including Zachariah\nand John the Baptist), claiming to have killed Jesus, accusing Mary of\nadultery, and dealing with usury. See 4:153-158.\n[38] The two angels, Hârût and Mârût, were sent to enlighten the people in\nBabylon so they would not confuse magic tricks with miracles. Still some\npeople abused this knowledge, causing mischief in the land. These\npractices persisted until the time of Solomon, who himself was falsely\naccused of utilizing magic to run his kingdom, subdue the jinn, and control\nthe wind.\n[39] Some of the disbelievers used to play with words when they addressed\nthe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in order to ridicule him. So instead of saying, râ’ina\n\n-- 604 of 694 --\n\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n“listen to us,” they would say, râ’îna “our shepherd” or “the foolish among\nus.” They would say loudly, “We listen,” then whisper, “but we disobey!”\nand say, “Hear us,” then, “may you never hear!” They used to say to each\nother, “If he had truly been a prophet of Allah, he would have known that\nwe are mocking him.” Therefore, this verse (along with 4:46) was revealed\ncommanding the believers to avoid such words altogether. Better words\nare recommended.\n[40] The Quran was revealed over a period of twenty-three years. New rules\nwere introduced when the believers were ready to accept and apply them.\nReplacing a ruling with another is called abrogation (naskh). For example,\nalcohol consumption was forbidden over three stages (see 2:219, 4:43, and\n5:90, respectively). Some of the Prophet’s companions said, “If drinking\nhad been forbidden from day one, no one would have accepted Islam!”\n[41] i.e., asking to make Allah visible to them and make the angels talk to\nthem.\n[42] Or “Such people should not have even entered these places except with\nreverence.”\n[43] lit., wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah.\n[44] His mercy and knowledge covers all.\n[45] The Christians, pagans, etc.\n[46] Jesus in Christianity, the angels in pagan Arab mythology, etc.\n[47] “The Sacred House” (Ka’bah) is a cube-shaped building in Mecca,\nIslam’s holiest sanctuary, which Muslims face when they pray five times a\nday.\n[48] “The standing-place of Abraham” is the stone on which Abraham stood\nwhile he was building the Ka’bah.\n[49] lit., make both of us Muslims. The word “Muslim” means “one who\nsubmits to Allah.” All of the prophets submitted to Allah and were,\ntherefore, Muslims.\n[50] For about sixteen months after daily prayers became obligatory, Muslims\nused to face towards Jerusalem before the order came to face a new qiblah\n(direction of prayer)—the Sacred Mosque in Mecca.\n[51] i.e., moderate, balanced, and outstanding.\n[52]\nṢafa and Marwah are two hills near the Ka’bah in Mecca.\n\n-- 605 of 694 --\n\n[53] Known as\nḥajj and ’umrah to the Sacred Mosque in Mecca.\n[54] Eating pork is forbidden in the Old Testament in Leviticus 11:7-8 and\nDeuteronomy 14:8.\n[55] The closest heirs of the victim of an intentional killing have the right to\ndemand the execution of the killer through legal channels. They also have\nthe right to waive the punishment as an act of charity.\n[56] No one else should be executed in place of the killer. This verse was\nrevealed regarding a particular incident. Nevertheless, the killer is killed\nregardless of the difference in gender or status, unless the victim’s family\nopts for blood money.\n[57] The guardian is the victim’s closest heir—male or female.\n[58] Or according to common law.\n[59] This ruling should be understood in light of the inheritance laws in 4:11-\n12, which give specific shares to parents and close relatives. Relatives who\ndo not have a share may get a bequest up to one third of the estate.\n[60] After the death of the one who made the will.\n[61] i.e., the followers of previous prophets.\n[62] i.e., the month of Ramaḍân, the 9th month in the Islamic calendar.\n[63] In the case of old age or chronic disease.\n[64] “Garment” (libâs) is a metaphor for comfort, chastity, and protection.\n[65] Initially, intimate relations during the night of Ramaḍân were not\npermissible. Since some Muslims could not resist not having intercourse\nwith their spouses, this verse was revealed allowing intimacy during the\nnights preceding the fast.\n[66] This implies offspring.\n[67] Before Islam, there was a superstitious practice for pilgrims to enter their\nhomes through the back door upon returning from the pilgrimage. The\nverse suggests that being devoted to Allah wholeheartedly is more\nimportant than blindly following old traditions.\n[68] “Do not exceed the limits” refers to Islamic warfare guidelines set by the\nProphet. In an authentic saying collected by Abu Dawûd, he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is\nreported to have instructed the Muslim army, “Depart in the Name of\nAllah and with His help—following the way of the Messenger of Allah.\nDo not kill an old man, a child, or a woman. Do not mutilate dead bodies\n\n-- 606 of 694 --\n\nof the enemy. Be gracious and courteous, for Allah loves those who act\nwith grace.” The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) also says, “Do not wish to meet your\nenemy in battle but always pray for well-being. If fighting is a must, then\nbe steadfast.”\n[69] This is probably the most misquoted verse from the Quran. To properly\nunderstand the verse, we need to put it into context. Misquoting verses and\ntaking them out of context can be applied to any scripture. For example, in\nthe Bible, Jesus says, “Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I\ndid not come to bring peace but a sword!” (Matthew 10:34). He also says,\n“But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king—\nbring them here and slaughter them in my presence!” (Luke 19:27). And\nMoses says, “The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name.” (Exodus\n15:3). For more details, see the Introduction.\n[70] Persecuting Muslims to abandon their faith.\n[71] The sacred months are the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islamic\ncalendar.\n[72]\nḤajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, is required at least once in a Muslim’s\nlifetime if they are physically and financially able to. ’Umrah, which is a\nshort version of\nḥajj, is recommended, but not obligatory.\n[73] Although pilgrimage is performed over the course of a few days in the\n12th month of the Islamic calendar, the intention to perform pilgrimage can\nbe made during the 10th, 11th, and the first half of the 12th months.\n[74] By trading during\nḥajj season.\n[75] ’Arafât is a hill in Saudi Arabia, near Mecca, which is visited during\npilgrimage.\n[76] A sacred place called Muzdalifah.\n[77] Swift in reckoning (sarî’ul-ḥisâb) means “He is quick in recording the\ndeeds and judging them.”\n[78] The 11th-13th of\t\nⱫul-\nḤijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic calendar.\nThese days are part of pilgrimage rituals.\n[79] Another possible translation: “And when they assume authority, they\nstrive …”\n[80] The pagans of Mecca.\n[81] See footnote for 2:194.\n\n-- 607 of 694 --\n\n[82] Persecuting Muslims to abandon their faith.\n[83] While many traditional scholars maintain that apostates are to be first\ninvited to re-enter the fold of Islam then executed if the invitation is turned\ndown, some traditional and modern scholars (like Sufyân Ath-Thawri, the\nlate Grand Imâm of Al-Azhar Sheikh Maḥmûd Shaltût, and Dr. Jamal\nBadawi) are of the opinion that the Quran (2:256) guarantees freedom of\nreligion and (2:217) promises no worldly punishment for leaving Islam. It\nis reported in a\nḥadîth collected by Imâm Muslim that a man came to the\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in Medina and retracted the allegiance he had pledged to\nhim (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)—leaving Islam. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) did not punish the\nman. The narrations that command the killing of apostates refer only to\nthose who fight against Muslims—so they are killed for treason, not for\napostasy. Other aḥâdîth are meant to deter those who conspired to accept\nIslam then leave it soon after only to shake the faith of early Muslims, as\nmentioned in 3:72.\n[84] See footnote for 4:43.\n[85] Literal translation, “They are your brothers.”\n[86] By not allowing partnership between you and orphans.\n[87] lit., “by His permission.”\n[88] Do not have intercourse with them until their menstruation is over and\nthey have taken a full bath.\n[89]\nḤarth means “farmland”—the husband being like a farmer, the wife like\nproductive land, and children like seeds—a metaphor for fertility and\ngrowth.\n[90] It is permissible to have intimate relations in any position, however anal\nsex is impermissible. Vaginal penetration during monthly cycles, or while\nbleeding persists after childbirth, up to forty days, is also not permitted.\n[91] This can either imply “sending forth good deeds that will be rewarded in\nthe next life” or—according to some interpretations—“engaging in\nforeplay with one’s spouse before intercourse.”\n[92] This ruling is called ilâ'. Ilâ' means that a husband vows not to be\nintimate with his wife because of a dispute or any other legitimate reason.\nThe verse here says if it is four months or less and the husband keeps his\nvow, then he does not have to make up for breaking his vow (by feeding\nten poor people, or fasting three days), otherwise he will need to make up\n\n-- 608 of 694 --\n\nfor breaking his vow. If the vow is made for over four months, the wife\nhas the right to seek divorce after four months. Ilâ' should be avoided\naltogether since it deprives the wife of her right to sexual satisfaction.\nInstead, counselling is a better alternative at the time of dispute.\n[93] This could mean “pregnancy” or “accurate information about monthly\ncycles.”\n[94] A husband may separate from his wife after each of the first two counts\nof divorce or at the end of her waiting period (see 65:1-5) with dignity. If\nhe chooses to stay with her after the first two counts of divorce then\ndivorces her a third time, the marriage is terminated at the end of her third\nwaiting period. The wife will have to marry and divorce another man\nbefore she can be remarried to her ex-husband (see 2:230). However, a\nwoman marrying someone with the intention of getting divorced, in order\nto return to her first husband, is forbidden.\n[95] The “limits of Allah” implies fidelity to one’s spouse according to\nAllah’s commands.\n[96] If the wife does not want to continue in the marriage for legitimate\nreasons, then she can return the dowry (mahr) to the husband in\ncompensation for divorce. This ruling is called khul’.\n[97] “Wisdom” means the “sunnah” or the tradition of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nwhen it is mentioned along with the Book (i.e., the Quran).\n[98] i.e., the guardians.\n[99] During their waiting periods.\n[100] The passage that discusses prayer falls between the passages that\ndiscuss divorce and women’s rights after divorce because it serves as a\nreminder that prayers should motivate spouses to always be mindful of\ntheir Lord during their marriage and also after divorce so no one will be\nwronged in anyway.\n101] As mentioned in several authentic sayings of Prophet Muḥammad\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), the middle prayer is the afternoon prayer, ’A\nṣr.\n[102] This ruling was later replaced by the ruling in 2:234.\n[103] They fled in the wake of a plague or an enemy attack.\n[104] Ṭalûṭ.\n[105] Reassurance refers to the Torah.\n\n-- 609 of 694 --\n\n[106] i.e., the staff of Moses and fragments of the Tablets.\n[107] Those messengers mentioned earlier in this sûrah (see verse 136).\n[108] i.e., Gabriel.\n[109] This implies ransoming one’s self.\n[110] i.e., friendly connections.\n111] The Arabic word kursi can either mean seat or knowledge. There are\nsome narrations attributed to Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) that describe\nAllah’s Throne (’Arsh) as being greater than His Kursi.\n112] According to Muslim belief, this is the greatest verse in the Quran.\n113] This verse was revealed when some new Muslims tried to force their\nJewish and Christian children to convert to Islam after the Prophet’s\nemigration (Hijrah) to Medina. The verse prohibits forced conversion.\n[114] Bringing the donkey back to life.\n115] It could also mean “… seeking Allah’s pleasure and proving their\nsincerity.”\n116] Donations for a public cause may be done openly to encourage others to\ndonate, whereas it is recommended to give charity to the poor secretly.\n[117] lit., seeking the Face of Allah.\n118] Verse 281 is believed by many scholars to be the last verse revealed of\nthe Quran.\n119] Generally speaking, there is a difference between witnessing and giving\ntestimony before a judge. Verse 2:282 talks about witnessing a debt\ncontract, not giving testimony. To fully understand the context of this\nverse, we need to keep in mind that 1500 years ago women did not\nnormally participate in business transactions or travel with trading\ncaravans and, therefore, not every woman had the expertise to witness a\ndebt contract. Even if two women were available at the time of signing\nthe contract, perhaps the primary witness might not be able to recall the\ndetails of the contract or appear before a judge because of compelling\ncircumstances such as pregnancy or delivery. In any of these cases, the\nsecond woman will be a back-up. Some scholars maintain that one\nwoman can be sufficient as a witness so long as she is reliable. As for\ngiving testimony, a ruling can be made based on available testimony,\nregardless of the number or gender of the witnesses. For example, the\n\n-- 610 of 694 --\n\nbeginning of Ramaḍân is usually confirmed by the sighting of the new\nmoon, regardless of the gender of the person who sights the moon. Also\nthe highest form of witness in Islam is for someone to testify they heard a\nnarration (or\nḥadîth) from the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). An authentic\nḥadîth is\naccepted by all Muslims regardless of the gender of the narrator.\nMoreover, if a husband accuses his wife of adultery and he has no\nwitnesses, each spouse must testify five times that they are telling the\ntruth and the other side is lying. Both testimonies are equal (see 24:6-10).\nIn some cases, only women’s testimony is accepted while men’s\ntestimony is rejected, such as testifying regarding a woman’s pregnancy\nor virginity.\n120] The Standard (Al-Furqân) is one of the names of the Quran.\n121] The precise verses are easy to understand and deal mostly with matters\nof belief and practice, such as the belief in one God (Sûrah 112),\nforbidden foods (see 5:3), and the commandments in 6:151-152 and\n17:23-39. As for the elusive verses, their full meaning is known only to\nAllah, such as the meaning of letter combinations at the beginning of\nsome sûrahs, such as Alif-Lãm-Mĩm (see Stylistic Features), and how\nAllah settles Himself on the Throne.\n122] Wealth and children were considered the most important things in pre-\nIslamic Arabia, and so the frequent mention of these things in the Quran\nis meant to represent all worldly gains.\n123] Badr is the name of the location where the Muslim army and the pagan\narmy of Mecca fought in 2 A.H./624 C.E. The Muslim army was made\nup of over 300 soldiers whereas the pagan army was over 1000.\n124] It can also be understood that the disbelievers were made to think there\nwere twice as many believers in the battlefield.\n125] Banîn means sons. In the ancient Arab culture, sons were a source of\npride for their parents and tribes. This is because they provided for their\nfamilies and took up arms in defence of their tribes.\n[126] See footnote for 2:25.\n127] Optional prayers before dawn are recommended and are more likely to\nbe accepted.\n[128] i.e., full submission to the Will of Allah.\n\n-- 611 of 694 --\n\n129] No community split into believers and disbelievers until they received\nthe knowledge given by their prophet.\n[130] This refers to the pagans of Arabia before Islam.\n[131] i.e., the Torah.\n132] Like 4:139 and 4:144, this verse forbids the believers from taking the\ndisbelievers who were at war with Muslims as strategic allies.\n[133] i.e., dedicating the child to service in the temple.\n[134] Service at the temple was hosted by males only.\n135] The prayers of Mary’s mother were answered. In a\nḥadîth collected by\nBukhâri and Muslim, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) says, “Every child is touched\nby Satan when they are born—and they cry because of this contact—\nexcept Jesus and his mother.”\n136] In the Quran, Jesus is called the “Word” of Allah since he was created\nwith the word “Be!”\n137] Messiah (Masîḥ) means the “anointed one.” It is used in the Quran\nexclusively as a title for Jesus Christ.\n138] ‘Mutawaffîka’ means literally: “I will make you reach the end of your\nworldly term.” The popular Muslim belief is that a conspiracy was made\nto kill Jesus. Allah made the main culprit who betrayed Jesus look\nexactly like Jesus, while the culprit was crucified. Similar to Christians,\nMuslims believe in the second coming of Jesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[139] As a testament to your prophethood.\n[140] The perception of Jesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[141] Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) being Jewish or Christian.\n142] Linguistically, “Muslim” means “someone who has submitted\nthemselves to Allah.”\n[143] Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[144] “Gentiles” here refers to the pagans of Arabia.\n[145] Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[146] i.e., full submission to the Will of Allah.\n147] Their repentance will not be accepted if they die as disbelievers.\n[148] Jacob (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n149] When Jacob fell sick, he made camel meat unlawful for himself, but not\nfor the rest of his people.\n\n-- 612 of 694 --\n\n150] Pilgrimage is obligatory on every Muslim at least once in their lifetime if\nthe person is physically and financially able.\n151] Meaning, always be conscious of Him; obedient and grateful to Him.\n[152] lit., except as Muslims.\n[153] i.e., Allah’s covenant.\n[154] i.e., they can only annoy you with their words.\n155] Uḥud is the name of the location where a battle took place in 3\nA.H./625 C.E. between 750 Muslims and 3700 Meccans. This battle\ncame only a year after the Meccan army was defeated at the Battle of\nBadr by the vastly outnumbered Muslim army. Initially, Muslims were\nwinning the second battle. However, events took a different turn when the\narchers, who had been positioned by the Prophet on the mount of Uḥud,\nleft their strategic position in pursuit of spoils of war—allowing a\nsurprise attack by the Meccan cavalry. Many Muslims were martyred and\nProphet Muḥammad himself was injured.\n156] When the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was injured at the Battle of Uḥud, some of\nhis companions suggested that he should pray against the pagans of\nMecca. He responded, “I have not come to condemn people, but as a\nmercy to pray for their guidance.” The verse here says that it is not up to\nthe Prophet whether they believe or disbelieve. A prophet’s only duty is\nto convey the message. Eventually, almost all Meccans accepted Islam\nbefore the death of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n157] “This” either refers to how the forces of evil are ultimately destroyed, or\nthat the Quran is a reminder of the destruction of evildoers.\n158] The faith of many Muslims was shaken when the pagan army spread\nrumours that Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was killed in the Battle of Uḥud.\n159] The archers disputed whether to keep their positions after the initial\nvictory. Eventually, most of them decided to go in pursuit of the spoils of\nwar, disobeying the Prophet’s direct orders not to leave their position no\nmatter what happened. Defeat became inevitable.\n[160] i.e., the hypocrites.\n[161] i.e., try not to die when your time comes.\n162] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) realized that the city of Medina became vulnerable\nafter the Muslim loss at Uḥud. So on the next day of the battle he decided\n\n-- 613 of 694 --\n\nto lead a small force of his companions—many of whom had been\nwounded at Uḥud—to chase away the Meccan army which was camping\nat a place called Ḥamrâ' Al-Asad—not far from Medina. Abu Sufyân,\ncommander of the Meccan army, sent a man to discourage the Muslims\nfrom following the Meccans. Although the man falsely claimed that the\nMeccans were mobilizing to launch a decisive attack on Medina, the\nProphet became more determined to chase them away. Eventually, the\nMeccans decided to flee and not waste their victory after the Prophet sent\na revert to Islam—who was friends with Abu Sufyân—to convince him\nto withdraw; otherwise Muslims were going to avenge their loss at Uḥud.\n163] This refers to the warning mentioned in 3:173.\n164] i.e., the distinction between the true believers and hypocrites.\n[165] i.e., your forefathers.\n166] i.e., the original Torah of Moses and the Gospel of Jesus.\n167] Meaning, a believer is always tested through the loss of wealth as well as\nsickness, injuries, and the loss of life.\n[168] The caller is Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n169] Râbi\nṭo refers to watching over the borders of one’s homeland. It can also\nmean keeping up one’s prayers.\n[170] i.e., Adam and Eve.\n171] The Quran is the only scripture that says marry only one. Unlike any\nprevious faith, Islam puts a limit on the number of wives a man can have.\nUnder certain circumstances, a Muslim man may marry up to four wives\nas long as he is able to provide for them and maintain justice among them\n—otherwise it is unlawful. With the exception of Jesus Christ and John\nthe Baptist (neither of whom were married), almost all religious figures\nin the Bible had more than one wife. According to the Bible, Solomon\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:3) and his\nfather, David (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), had many wives and concubines (2 Samuel 5:13).\n172] A bondwoman is a female slave that a man owned either through\npurchase or taking her captive in war—a common ancient practice in\nmany parts of the world. Islam opened the door for ending slavery by\nmaking it an act of charity to free slaves. Many sins (such as breaking\none’s oath, unintentional killing, and intercourse with one’s wife during\nthe day of fasting in Ramaḍân) can be atoned by freeing a slave.\n\n-- 614 of 694 --\n\nAccording to Islamic teachings, no free person can be enslaved. Islam\nalso improved the condition of slaves. It was unlawful to separate a\nmother from her child. Children born to a slave-master were deemed free,\nand their mother would gain her freedom upon the death of her master.\nWith regards to slaves, Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) says, “Feed them\nfrom what you eat, clothe them from what you wear, and do not\noverwhelm them with work unless you assist them.” He (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) also\nsays, “Whoever kills his slave will be killed and whoever injures his\nslave will be injured.” In recent times, slavery has been outlawed in all\ncountries—including the Muslim world.\n173] Inheritance entitlements of immediate family members (children,\nparents, full- and half-brothers and sisters, and spouses) are given in the\nfollowing verses: 7, 11-13, 32-33, and 176. Shares are determined mainly\naccording to the closeness of the heir to the deceased (i.e., close relatives\nget more than distant relatives), age (i.e., those who are young get more\nthan those who are old), and—to a lesser degree—gender.\n174] For example, in the case of orphaned children whose grandfather then\ndies, leaving behind other children, some scholars rule that an obligatory\nbequest should be made to them despite not having a share in inheritance.\n175] According to Islamic law of inheritance, a female—whether she is a\nmother, a wife, a sister, a daughter, etc.—gets one of three shares,\ndepending on her closeness to the deceased:\n1. Less than a male’s share. If she is a daughter, she will get half\nof the share of her brother, since he—unlike his sister—has to\nprovide for the family and pay a dowry at the time of his\nmarriage.\n2. More than a male’s share. For example, if a man leaves $24\n000 and six sons, two brothers, a wife, and a mother. The wife\nwill get one-eighth ($3000), the mother one-sixth ($4000), each\nof the sons will receive about $2 833 and the two brothers will\nnot get anything.\n3. An equal share. This is in the case of siblings from the\nmother’s side (mentioned in verse 12 of this sûrah).\n176] \"Offspring” here means any number of children—male or female.\n177] And the father will take the rest of the estate.\n\n-- 615 of 694 --\n\n178] Although the existence of siblings reduces the mother’s share from one-\nthird to one-sixth, siblings themselves do not receive a share of\ninheritance and the rest of the estate goes to the father.\n179] Debts as well as any other financial obligations (such as funeral\nexpenses, unfulfilled vows, or unpaid dowry) have to be repaid before the\nfulfilment of bequests, then the estate can be distributed among the heirs.\nA person can bequest up to one-third of their estate for charities as well\nas individuals who are not entitled to a share in inheritance.\n180] You do not know who will benefit you by looking after you during your\nlife or doing good deeds on your behalf after your death.\n181] If there are two or more brothers and sisters from the mother’s side, they\nshare one-third equally—the female will receive the same share of the\nmale.\n182] Harming the heirs includes giving away more than one-third of the estate\nas a bequest.\n183] The popular interpretation among Muslim scholars is that verses 15 and\n16 refer to male and female premarital/extramarital relations, though the\npunishment was later abrogated by 24:2. A few scholars maintain that\nthese two verses refer to homosexuality. Their argument is that, unlike\nother verses in the Quran that talk about illegal relations between males\nand females, each of these two verses specifies a gender—females in the\nfirst and males in the second.\n184] A person’s repentance will be accepted as long as they repent any time\nbefore their death. But one should not procrastinate because they do not\nknow when they will die.\n185] For example, a man would prevent a female relative (such as his sister or\nmother) from getting married so he can secure her estate for himself.\n186] lit., blatant misconduct. If someone’s wife has been found guilty of\nadultery, he has the right to ask for his dowry back.\n187] i.e., the promise to live with her in kindness or divorce her with dignity.\n188] Marriage to any of the listed women became null and void with the\nrevelation of these verses.\n189] A man was not allowed to have a relationship with a bondwoman who\nhe had taken captive in war unless he made sure she was not pregnant.\n\n-- 616 of 694 --\n\nThis was verified by her having at least one monthly cycle. See footnote\nfor 4:3.\n190] Do not be ashamed to marry a bondwoman since you are all part of the\nsame human family and Allah knows you are doing so to avoid illegal\nrelationships.\n191] A married slave-woman is forbidden from having a relationship with her\nmaster.\n[192] i.e., fifty lashes.\n[193] i.e., Paradise.\n194] This pledge was a common practice before Islam between friends and\nallies—taking oaths to inherit each other. This practice came to an end\nwith the revelation of verse 8:75 of the Quran. Although friends and\nallies do not have a share in inheritance anymore, they still can get some\nof the estate through bequest.\n[195] i.e., their husbands’ honour and wealth.\n196] Disciplining one’s wife gently is the final resort. The earliest\ncommentators understood that this was to be light enough not to leave a\nmark, should be done with nothing bigger than a tooth stick, and should\nnot be on the face. Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said to his companions\n“Do not beat the female servants of Allah.” He said that honourable\nhusbands do not beat their wives, and he himself never hit a woman or a\nservant. If a woman feels her husband is ill-behaved, then she can get\nhelp from her guardian or seek divorce.\n197] lit., the smallest particle of dust (\nⱬarrah).\n198] Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) asked one of his companions, ’Abdullah\nibn Mas’ûd, to recite some verses of the Quran for him because he loved\nto hear it from someone other than himself. ’Abdullah recited from the\nbeginning of this sûrah until he reached verse 42. When he was told he\nmay stop, ’Abdullah said he looked at the face of Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and\nsaw tears rolling down his cheeks.\n199] Intoxicants were prohibited in the Quran in three stages: 2:219, 4:43, and\nfinally 5:90-91.\n200] i.e., after sexual intercourse or a wet dream.\n201] This ruling is called tayammum or ‘dry ablution.’ If someone cannot find\nwater or is unable to use it because of illness or cold weather, then they\n\n-- 617 of 694 --\n\nare allowed to touch clean earth, sand, etc. with the palms of their hands\nonce then blow in their hands and wipe over their face and hands.\n202] See footnote for 2:104.\n203] See 7:163-165.\n204] A person will never be forgiven if they die as a disbeliever. But if they\nrepent before their death and mend their ways, then their repentance will\nbe accepted (see 25:68-70).\n205] i.e., the polytheists.\n[206] i.e., Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) or Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[207] See footnote for 2:25.\n208] This verse was revealed right after Mecca had peacefully surrendered to\nthe Muslims. ’Ali ibn Abi Ṭâlib, the Prophet’s cousin and son-in-law,\ntook the Ka’bah’s key by force from Othmân ibn Ṭalḥa, the non-Muslim\nkeeper of the Ka’bah. The verse was revealed to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\ninside the Ka’bah with the order to give the key back to its rightful\nowner. He (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) ordered Ali to return the key to the keeper\nimmediately along with an apology. Othmân was also promised that his\nfamily would keep the key forever. The keeper was so touched by the\nQuranic sense of justice that he decided to accept Islam.\n[209] i.e., obeying Allah and His Messenger.\n210] Both good and evil are destined by Allah. The good comes as Allah’s\nreward for good deeds, whereas the bad comes as Allah’s punishment for\nevil deeds. In some cases, bad things happen to good people to test their\nfaith, or as an atonement for their sins, or as part of a process of replacing\nsomething with what is better (e.g., a job or a spouse).\n211] i.e., when they get the news of victory or a threat.\n212] The verse discusses a group of people who nominally became Muslims\nand secretly supported the enemies of Muslims. For those hypocrites to\nprove their loyalty, they were commanded to emigrate and join the ranks\nof the believers, or they would be considered enemies.\n213] If a Muslim commits a major sin (such as intentional killing or adultery)\nand dies without repenting, they will be punished in Hell according to the\nseverity or magnitude of the sin, then eventually be taken out of Hell. No\nMuslim will stay in Hell forever.\n\n-- 618 of 694 --\n\n[214] i.e., spoils of war.\n[215] This includes women, the elderly, the sick, etc.\n216] This verse refers to some of those who had accepted Islam secretly in\nMecca but refused to emigrate to Medina along with the rest of the\nbelievers. Some of them were killed in the Battle of Badr when they were\nrallied by the Meccans to fight against the Muslims. The verse also\napplies to any Muslim who accepts abuse and refuses to move to another\nplace where they can live with dignity and practice their faith freely.\n217] Generally, it is permissible for Muslims who are travelling a distance of\n85 km or more to shorten their prayers. A four-unit prayer is reduced to\ntwo.\n218] When the first group prays, the second group stands guard behind them,\nthen the first group withdraws to the back when they finish their prayers\nand stand guard when the second group moves up to pray.\n219] Verses 105-112 were revealed in defence of Zaid ibn As-Samîn, a\nJewish man, who was falsely accused of theft. A shield was stolen by a\nMuslim named Ṭu’mah ibn Obairaq and entrusted to Zaid. Ṭu’mah’s\nfamily rushed to his defence and accused Zaid of the crime. They also\ntried to influence Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to make a decision in\nfavour of Ṭu’mah and punish the Jew, but the verses were soon revealed\ndeclaring Zaid’s innocence.\n220] lit., deceive themselves.\n221] This applies to those who die in a state of disbelief in Allah. But those\nwho repent before their death and mend their ways, their repentance will\nbe accepted (see 25:68-70).\n222] The pagans of Arabia used to shape their idols as females and give them\nfeminine names such as Al-Lât, Al-’Uzza, and Manât.\n223] Slitting the ears of cattle dedicated to idols was a superstitious practice\nbefore Islam.\n[224] This refers to verses 2-11 of this sûrah.\n225] i.e., their inheritance and dowries.\n226] This implies that many husbands and wives are unwilling to give the\nother their rights.\n\n-- 619 of 694 --\n\n227] Do not leave one hanging—not fully enjoying the rights of a married\nwoman and not fully divorced.\n[228] This refers to 6:68.\n229] i.e., Allah does not like talking about people behind their backs—except\nwhen someone who has been wronged seeks counselling or assistance\nfrom authorities.\n230] By their claim that they believe in Allah but still reject some of His\nmessengers.\n231] i.e., they demanded the Quran to be revealed all at once in writing\nsimilar to the Tablets of Moses. This demand is refuted in 25:32.\n232] Their hearts are unreceptive because they claim they have enough\nknowledge already.\n233] i.e., they slandered Mary by claiming that she conceived Jesus through\nan illegal relationship.\n234] The popular belief among Muslims is that a conspiracy was made to kill\nJesus, Allah made the main culprit who betrayed Jesus look exactly like\nJesus, then he was crucified in Jesus’ place. Jesus was raised safe and\nsound to the heavens. Muslims also believe in the second coming of Jesus\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n235] Scholars disagree whether Jews and Christians will come to realize that\nJesus is a prophet of Allah at the time of their death or before the death of\nJesus after his second coming.\n236] The Jews are warned against denying Jesus as the Messiah, while\nChristians are warned against calling Jesus Allah.\n237] i.e., Jesus was created by Allah’s Word “Be!” and he was, and life was\nbreathed into Jesus by the holy spirit (the angel Gabriel) at the command\nof Allah.\n238] This ruling also applies to brothers and sisters from the father’s side—if\nthey are the only heirs.\n239] This verse is placed at the end of the sûrah and not with similar verses at\nthe beginning to connect the end of this sûrah with the next one or,\naccording to Al-Fakhr Ar-Râzi, either to tie the end of the sûrah with its\nbeginning for emphasis, as found in 20:2 and 124 as well as 23:1 and\n\n-- 620 of 694 --\n\n117, or to emphasize Allah’s knowledge, just like the first verse\nemphasizes His power.\n240] To make a decision in pre-Islamic Arabia, a person would draw one of\nthree straws: one saying “Do it,” the other “Do not do it,” and the third\nwas left blank, whereas in Islam there is a special prayer (called\nistikhârah) for guidance when making a decision.\n241] “The food of the People of the Book” here means the meat of the\nanimals slaughtered by the Jews and Christians.\n242] For example, following sexual intercourse or a wet dream.\n243] This ruling is called tayammum or ‘dry ablution.’ See footnote for 4:43.\n244] He rescued you from Egypt where the Pharaoh treated you like slaves\nand blessed you with freedom so you can manage your own affairs.\n245] i.e., the miracles of splitting the sea, water coming out of the rock,\nmanna and quails, and clouds shading them.\n[246] Hâbîl and Qâbîl, respectively.\n247] In Islam, regret for doing something wrong is essential for repentance.\nBut in the case of Cain, his regret was not for killing his brother, but for\nfailing to bury his corpse to hide the evidence of his crime. Therefore, his\nregret was not intended as a step towards repentance.\n248] Although this is addressed to the Children of Israel, it is applicable to\neveryone at all times.\n249] This ruling (called\t\nḥirâbah) applies to crimes committed by armed\nindividuals or groups against civilians—Muslim or non-Muslim.\nDifferent punishments apply depending on the severity of the crime:\n1. In the case of murder or rape, offenders are to be executed.\n2. In the case of armed robbery, offenders’ right hands and left\nfeet are to be cut off.\n3. In the case of terrorizing innocent people, offenders are to be\njailed in exile.\n4. Penalties for lesser offences are left for the judge to decide.\n250] In Islam, strict conditions must be met for punishments to be carried out.\nFor example, for someone to be punished for theft, the thief must be a\nsane adult who knows that theft is forbidden, the crime has to be proven\neither by confession or the testimony of two reliable eyewitnesses, the\nstolen item has to be of value and taken secretly from a safe place, and\n\n-- 621 of 694 --\n\nthe owner has to claim it. Otherwise, the punishment is not applied.\nIslamic punishments apply neither in non-Muslim countries nor in\nMuslim countries where Sharî’ah is not fully applied. Moreover, the\npunishment is only applicable in a society where the needs of the poor are\nadequately met (i.e., they receive alms-tax, charity, or welfare) and where\ntheft is more out of desire than necessity. It is worth mentioning that\n’Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭâb, Islam’s 2nd Caliph, suspended this punishment\nfor one year due to widespread famine.\n[251] i.e., bribes and interest.\n252] Wali means guardian, caretaker, protector, provider, ally, etc. The\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) for example says, “A woman should not get married\nwithout a wali.”—that is a guardian such as her father to represent her in\nthe marriage and make sure she receives her full rights. The verse forbids\nMuslims from allying with the Jews and Christians (or anyone else)\nconspiring to persecute Muslims. On the other hand, as long as non-\nMuslims are not at war with Muslims or persecuting them, the Quran\n(60:8) commands Muslims to be kind and gracious to them.\n253] Literally or metaphorically. See footnote for 2:65.\n[254] lit., Allah’s Hand is tied up ˹with greed˺.\n[255] See footnote for 2:62.\n256] i.e., they were in need of food for nourishment. According to some\nscholars, this implies that Jesus and his mother had to relieve themselves\nafter the food had been digested. Almighty Allah is far above depending\non food or having to go to the restroom.\n257] i.e., the pagans.\n258] See footnote for 5:3.\n259] Some Muslims would ask the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) unnecessary and\nsometimes meaningless questions. For example: who their fathers were,\nwhere their lost animals were, what they had in their pockets, etc. Some\nwould even demand new rulings that would probably make things\ndifficult for some Muslims or even themselves.\n260] This implies that either these minor details have been overlooked by\nAllah out of His mercy or that Allah has forgiven them for these\nunnecessary questions.\n\n-- 622 of 694 --\n\n261] These camels were allowed by pagan Arabs to pasture freely and were\nnot to be used for labour or transportation after fathering or giving birth\nto a certain number of male or female camels.\n[262] i.e., the pagans.\n263] After fulfilling their obligation of delivering the truth, enjoining what is\ngood, and forbidding what is evil.\n[264] If no Muslim witnesses can be found.\n[265] i.e., the angel Gabriel.\n[266] lit., Muslims.\n267] This refers to the ascension of Jesus Christ. See footnote for 3:54.\n268] i.e., as Your creation, they cannot escape the punishment.\n269] “Light” is always used in the Quran in the singular (nûr), whereas\n“darkness” is used in the plural (\nẓulumât). Nûr is usually used in a\nmetaphorical sense to refer to true guidance, whereas\nẓulumât refers to\ndifferent forms of misguidance.\n270] i.e., created your father, Adam, from clay. Some scholars suggest that if\nwe examine all the minerals found in the earth (potassium, nitrogen, and\ncarbon), we find that these are the same minerals that make up our body.\nFurthermore when we die, our bodies are absorbed back into the ground.\nAnd when we are resurrected, we will be resurrected from the ground\n(see 20:55).\n271] Similar to the Tablets of Moses.\n272] i.e., they would have been destroyed immediately upon denying the\nangel.\n273] Allah has created living beings (like animals, birds, and fish) just like He\ncreated human beings. He provides for all and is merciful to all. They all\nbelong to communities and have their own systems of living.\n274] The Record refers to the Preserved Tablet (Al-Law\nḥ Al-Ma\nḥfû\nẓ) in\nwhich Allah has written the destiny of His entire creation.\n275] Some of the influential leaders of Mecca asked the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to\nsend poor Muslims away if he ever wanted these elites to sit and listen to\nhis message. These verses were revealed commanding the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to keep the company of the poor and not alienate them.\n[276] lit., seeking His Face.\n\n-- 623 of 694 --\n\n277] The five keys of the unseen are mentioned in 31:34.\n278] See footnote for 6:38.\n279] lit., their faith (which they are supposed to follow).\n280] Allah grants authority to some of His servants in this world, but none\nwill have authority on Judgment Day except Him. See 3:26.\n281] On the Day of Judgment, the Trumpet will be blown by an angel—\ncausing all to die. When it is blown a second time, everyone will be\nraised from the dead for judgment (see 39:68).\n282] i.e., associating false gods in worship with the Almighty.\n[283] i.e., the companions of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[284] Some Jews.\n285] “The Mother of Cities” is an honorary title given to the city of Mecca\nbecause of its great religious significance as the home of Allah’s first\nhouse of worship ever built on earth, and perhaps because of its central\nlocation as well.\n[286] i.e., Adam (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n287] Jinn are another creation of Allah, made of “smokeless fire,” and inhabit\na realm parallel to our own. Like us, they have free will and can choose\nguidance or disobedience.\n[288] i.e., “Jesus” in Christian belief.\n[289] i.e., “the angels” in pre-Islamic Arab tradition.\n290] No one is able to see Allah in this world, but there is extensive evidence\nin the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) that the believers\nwill be able to see their Lord on the Day of Judgment.\n291] Allegations have always been made that the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) copied the\nQuran from the Bible, mostly because of similar narratives in both\nScriptures (such as the stories of Adam, Joseph, Moses, and others).\nHistorically, the Bible was not translated into Arabic until centuries after\nthe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Even if an Arabic translation of the Bible existed at\nhis time, he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) could not have copied it because he could not read\nor write. From an Islamic point of view, similarities stem from the fact\nthat both scriptures came originally from the same source—divine\nrevelation. For more details, see the Introduction.\n\n-- 624 of 694 --\n\n292] Because Muslims are allowed to eat the meat of animals slaughtered\nproperly and not carrion, the pagans of Mecca used to argue, “Why are\nyou only allowed to eat what you yourselves kill but not what Allah\ncauses to die?”\n293] The Quran often compares disbelief to death and blindness whereas\nbelief is compared to life and the ability to see.\n[294] Islam literally means ‘submission to the Will of Allah.’\n295] For example, the jinn helped humans with magic, while the jinn had a\nfeeling of importance when they had a human following.\n296] i.e., disobedient Muslims. They will be punished according to the\nseverity of their sins, but eventually no Muslim will stay in Hell forever.\n297] The pagans used to assign Allah a share of their property (as a charity to\nthe poor) and another to their idols (as a fee to idol keepers). However,\nAllah’s share always ended up in the pockets of the keepers, whereas the\nshare of false gods was never donated to the poor.\n298] Some pagan Arabs used to kill their own children (especially females)\nfor fear of poverty. Others would vow to sacrifice a son if blessed with a\ncertain number of sons.\n[299] Or trellised and untrellised.\n300] These four pairs were the main domesticated cattle in Arabia at the time\nof revelation.\n301] Strong cattle like camels and oxen can be used for labour, whereas\nsmaller ones like goats and sheep are not suitable for labour but are good\nfor their meat, milk, hide, etc.\n302] For example, in retaliation for intentional killing through legal channels.\n[303] i.e., when you testify or judge.\n[304] i.e., the Quran.\n305] This refers to disobedient believers who neither did any good nor\nrepented before the time of their death or the arrival of the Day of\nJudgment. This is supported by authentic narrations from the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[306] i.e., your father, Adam (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[307] See footnote for 2:34.\n\n-- 625 of 694 --\n\n308] Satan asked to be allowed to live until humans are resurrected in order to\nescape death at the end of time. He was told he was going to live only\nuntil the time appointed by Allah Almighty.\n309] There will be enmity between humans and Satan.\n310] It was customary for the pagans of Mecca to circle the Ka’bah while\nnaked. So verses 26-31 of this sûrah were revealed commanding the\nbelievers to cover themselves properly when praying to their Lord.\n311] The pleasures of this worldly life are shared by believers and\ndisbelievers, whereas the pleasures of the Hereafter will be enjoyed\nexclusively by the believers.\n312] i.e., they will receive all provisions and bounties destined for them by\ntheir Lord.\n313] i.e., the bitterness they had in their hearts towards other believers who\nwronged them in the worldly life.\n314] This is a group of people whose good deeds equal their bad deeds, so\nthey will be held on the heights separating Paradise and Hellfire until\ntheir judgment is settled.\n315] Although the word “rijâl” generally means “men,” some Quran\ncommentators believe that the word “rijâl” here can also mean “people,”\nbut they are called men since men make up the majority in the group. In\nsome Arabic dialects, “rijâl” is the plural of “rajul” (man) and “rajulah”\n(woman).\n316] The faces of the residents of Paradise will be bright, whereas those of the\nresidents of Hell will be gloomy.\n317] lit., their faith (which they are supposed to follow).\n318] The word day is not always used in the Quran to mean a 24-hour period.\nAccording to 22:47, a heavenly Day is 1000 years of our time. The Day\nof Judgment will be 50 000 years of our time (see 70:4). Hence, the six\nDays of creation refer to six eons of time, known only by Allah.\n319] They argued that life has its ups and downs and, therefore, they did not\nperceive adversity as a punishment or prosperity as a test—arguing that\nthe same thing happened to their ancestors.\n[320] lit., as Muslims.\n[321] As we did before the birth of Moses.\n\n-- 626 of 694 --\n\n[322] In psychology, this is called self-serving bias and scapegoating.\n[323] i.e., their drowning in the sea.\n324] Allah reminds Moses that even though his request to see Allah was\ndenied, he has already been favoured by Allah over the people of his time\nthrough prophethood and direct communication with the Almighty.\n325] To follow the commandments that generate more rewards than others, to\nput grace before justice, etc.\n326] This could either mean the ruins of destroyed nations or the Hellfire\nwhich is the home of the wicked.\n327] For asking Moses to make Allah visible to them.\n328] Some Muslim scholars cite Deuteronomy 18:15-18 and 33:2, Isaiah 42,\nand John 14:16 as examples of the description of Prophet Muḥammad in\nthe Bible. However, Bible scholars interpret these verses differently. The\nname of Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) appears several times in the\nGospel of Barnabas, which is deemed apocryphal by Christian\nauthorities.\n329] Manna (heavenly bread) and quails (chicken-like birds) sustained the\nchildren of Israel in the wilderness after they left Egypt.\n330] The people of Aylah, an ancient town by the Red Sea, were forbidden to\ncatch fish on the Sabbath. However, on Saturdays fish were everywhere,\nwhereas on weekdays no fish were seen. To get around the prohibition,\nsome decided to lay their nets on Fridays and collect the fish caught in\ntheir nets on Sundays. Those opposed to this practice were divided into\ntwo groups: one group tried to convince the offenders to honour the\nSabbath, but soon gave up when their advice was not taken seriously. The\nsecond group was persistent in giving advice to the Sabbath-breakers.\nEventually, the Sabbath-breakers were punished whereas the other two\ngroups were saved.\n[331] Literally or metaphorically. See footnote for 2:65.\n332] The mountain was raised over their heads when Moses came to them\nwith the teachings of the Torah and was met with defiance. So the\nmountain was raised as a miracle and a display of Allah’s infinite power\nover them.\n333] Bal’am ibn Ba’ûrâ' was a scholar who lived at the time of Moses but\nlater deviated from the truth.\n\n-- 627 of 694 --\n\n334] Regardless of whether they are warned or not, still they will not believe.\n335] Those who twist Allah’s Names then use them to call false gods. For\nexample, Allât, a name of one of the idols was derived from Allah (the\nOne God), Al-’Uzza was derived from Al-’Azîz (the Almighty), and\nManât was derived from Al-Mannân (the Bestower).\n[336] i.e., Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[337] lit., their brothers.\n338] Following the victory of the Muslims over the Meccan army at Badr,\nsome Muslims disagreed on the way the spoils of war should be\ndistributed, so these verses were revealed.\n339] After many years of persecution in Mecca, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and\nmany of his early followers decided to emigrate secretly to Medina, about\n250 miles to the north, leaving behind their homes and valuables, which\nwere soon taken over by the pagans of Mecca. To avenge this financial\nloss, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) decided to capture an unarmed Meccan trade\ncaravan headed by Abu Sufyân, a Meccan chief. Eventually, the caravan\nescaped, but the Meccans mobilized an army of over 1000 well-armed\nsoldiers, more than three times the size of the Muslim force. Many\nMuslims had hoped to capture the caravan without having to meet the\nMeccan army in battle. Although the Muslims were vastly outnumbered\nand lightly-armed, they still won this decisive battle.\n340] Five thousand angels in total, as mentioned in 3:125.\n341] This happened the night before the battle.\n342] Before the battle, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) threw a handful of sand at the\ndisbelievers and prayed for their defeat.\n[343] This refers metaphorically to the disbelievers who fail to see and hear\nthe truth.\n[344] i.e., Mecca.\n345] The battle was not planned since the Muslim force was after the caravan.\nHad the two armies made plans to meet in battle at that time and place,\nthey both probably would have missed each other.\n[346] Who survived the Battle of Badr.\n[347] i.e., ransom.\n[348] The decree that ransoming captives will be allowed.\n\n-- 628 of 694 --\n\n349] This verse ended a previous ruling that allowed inheritance between\nMuslims from Mecca (Al-Muhâjirûn, the Emigrants) and Muslims from\nMedina (Al-An\nṣâr, the Helpers). Now, only relatives can inherit from one\nanother, whereas non-heirs can receive a share through bequest, up to one\nthird of the estate. See 4:7, 11-13, 32-33, and 176.\n350] This is the only sûrah in the Quran that does not begin with: “In the\nName of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.” The reason is\nthat this sûrah is considered to be a continuation of the previous one, and\nthat it begins with an open termination of treaties not fully respected by\nthe polytheists. Since this constitutes a declaration of war, it would not be\nfitting to open with the mention of Allah’s compassion and mercy.\n351] The 10th of\nⱫul-\nḤijjah, a significant day in the greater pilgrimage (\nḥajj).\nThe lesser pilgrimage is known as ’umrah.\n352] i.e., inside or outside the sanctuary of the Sacred House in Mecca.\n353] This is known as the Treaty of Ḥudaibiyah, which was signed by the\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and the pagans of Mecca in 6 A.H./628 C.E., diffusing\nthe tension between Muslims and the Meccans and affirming a 10-year\npeace truce. The treaty was violated by the Meccans in 8 A.H/630 C.E.\n354] After the Muslims’ victory in Mecca in 8 A.H/630 C.E., almost all Arab\ntribes pledged allegiance to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) except some tribes such\nas Hawâzin and Thaqîf. Both tribes decided to attack the Muslims, so the\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) led an army of 12 000 soldiers to attack the two tribes.\nSince that was the largest Muslim army ever mobilized, some Muslims\nexpressed their conviction that such an army could not be defeated.\nHowever, on the way to battle, the Muslim army was ambushed and most\nsoldiers fled, except for the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and a few loyalists.\nEventually, the Muslims were re-organized and won a decisive battle.\n[355] lit., tranquility.\n[356] i.e., angels.\n357] i.e., Allah will accept those who embrace Islam. Almost all of Arabia\nbecame Muslim before the death of Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in 11\nA.H./632 C.E.\n358] i.e., impure spiritually because of idolatry, not physically.\n359] The 9th year of the Prophet’s migration from Mecca to Medina.\n\n-- 629 of 694 --\n\n360] To fully understand this verse we need to bear in mind that Quranic\nverses are of two types. General verses talk about belief in Allah, good\nmanners, and acts of worship. Specific verses, such as this verse, were\nrevealed in regards to particular situations. This sûrah came at a time\nwhen the pagans of Arabia (and their allies) repeatedly violated treaties\nthey had signed with the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Muslims had to fight for the\nsurvival of their newly established state in Medina. So this verse\ndiscusses dealing with those who violated their agreements and attacked\nthe Muslims. Offenders were fought, unless they stopped their\naggression. If they chose not to accept Islam, they were obligated to pay\nJizya-tax.\n361] Taxation systems have existed since ancient times. There are several\nreferences in the Old Testament (e.g., Ezra 4:20). In the New Testament,\nJesus allows paying taxes to Caesar (Luke 20:25). Under Islamic rule, all\nindividuals had financial obligations—Muslims paid zakâh (2.5% of their\nsavings) and non-Muslims (\nⱬimmîs) were required to pay jizyah (tax for\nprotection from foreign enemies). The jizyah was an average of one dinar\n(4.25 g of gold) annually. Women, children, the elderly, the clergy, the\npoor, and those who were unable to work were exempt. Those who opted\nto join the army were also exempt. Poor\t\nⱬimmîs were supported\nfinancially by the state. Muslim rulers refunded the jizyah if they failed to\nprotect their non-Muslim subjects.\n362] When ’Adi ibn Ḥâtim, a companion of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), heard this\nverse, he said, “But the Jews and Christians do not worship their rabbis\nand monks!” The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) replied, “Do the rabbis and monks not\nforbid the permissible and permit the forbidden, and they obey them?”\n’Adi answered, “Yes, they do.” The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) concluded, “This is\nhow they worship them.” Collected by At-Tirmiⱬi.\n[363] i.e., religion of truth.\n364] i.e., the Preserved Tablet in which everything is written.\n365] The sacred months are the 11th, 12th, 1st, and 7th of the Islamic calendar.\nSince the polytheists knew that it was forbidden to fight in the sacred\nmonths, they used to transfer the sanctity to other months, say for\nexample, the 3rd, 4th, 8th, and 10th as long as they maintained the sanctity\nof any four months throughout the year.\n\n-- 630 of 694 --\n\n366] The fast pace of the spread of Islam in Arabia in the 7th century was\nintimidating to the world’s two superpowers of that time: the Romans and\nPersians. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received the news that a Roman army\nwas being mobilized to launch an attack on the newly established Muslim\nstate in Medina, so he announced that he was going to march to Tabûk,\nlocated over 700 miles to the north, to meet the Romans in the summer of\n9 A.H./631 C.E. It was a time of hardship because of the scorching heat,\nthe long distance, and the financial situation of the Muslims. Although\nthe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was able to mobilize over 30 000 Muslims for\nbattle, many others did not join the army with or without valid excuses.\nEventually, the Roman forces were discouraged from fighting and fled to\nDamascus and other cities under Roman rule. Therefore, the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) returned to Medina with a feeling of triumph. With a new power\nnow emerging in Arabia, many tribes started to switch their alliances\nfrom Caesar to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n367] Abu Bakr Aṣ-Ṣiddîq, Islam’s first Caliph and a prominent figure in\nIslamic history. He accompanied the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) during his\nemigration from Mecca to Medina after years of persecution at the hands\nof the Meccan pagans.\n368] For example, ’Abdullâh ibn Ubai ibn Salûl, a chief hypocrite, marched\nwith the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) for the Battle of Uḥud in the outskirts of\nMedina, then decided not to join the fight and returned to Medina with\nhis followers who made up around one third of the Muslim army.\n369] Another hypocrite by the name of Jadd ibn Qais came to the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) asking to be exempt from joining the army because he had a\nweakness for women and he was afraid that he would be tempted by\nRoman women.\n370] i.e., those who will repent.\n371] The overturned cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n372] i.e., some of them tried to assassinate the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) on the way\nback from Tabûk.\n373] Not only did the hypocrites withhold their wealth, but they were also\ncritical of those who donated. If a rich believer gave generously, the\nhypocrites would say, “He is showing off,” and if a poor believer gave\nwhat they could afford, they would say, “This is not good enough.”\n\n-- 631 of 694 --\n\n374] i.e., the early Muslims who emigrated from Mecca to Medina, known as\nAl-Muhâjirûn.\n375] i.e., those from Medina, known as Al-An\nṣâr, who accepted Islam and\nsheltered Muslim emigrants from Mecca.\n376] Through disgrace in this world and bad ending of their lives.\n377] They have mixed their adherence to Islam with their disobedience to\nmarch forth with the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to Tabûk.\n378] This verse refers to Ka’b ibn Mâlik, Murarah ibn Rabi’, and Hilâl ibn\nUmaiyah, the three companions who remained in Medina with no excuse,\nbut were honest about what they did. They were boycotted by Muslims\nfor about fifty days until verses 118-119 of this sûrah were revealed\ndeclaring the acceptance of their repentance.\n3 7 9 ] Abu ’Âmer Ar-Râhib was a monk who fought against Muslims at the\nBattle of Badr. He ordered a group of twelve hypocrites to build a\nmosque near the Mosque of Qubâ', the first mosque built by Muslims and\nalso where the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his companions would pray. The\nnew mosque, commonly referred to as Masjid A\nḍ-\nḌirâr (Mosque of\nHarm), was intended to attract other hypocrites and reduce the number of\nMuslims who prayed at Qubâ'. The hypocrites who built the mosque also\nanticipated the arrival of Abu ’Âmer with Roman forces to expel the\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and Muslims out of Medina. Upon a request from these\nhypocrites, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had planned to visit the new mosque\nonce he returned from Tabûk, but verses 107-110 of this sûrah were\nrevealed, warning the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) against that mosque. According\nto some narrations, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) ordered this mosque to be\nburned down.\n[380] See footnote for 7:46.\n381] Abraham promised to pray for his father’s forgiveness in 19:47 and 60:4,\nbut when his father died as a disbeliever he discontinued praying for him.\n382] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is forgiven for exempting all those who came to\nhim with excuses regardless of their honesty, or for seeking forgiveness\nfor the polytheists.\n[383] See footnote for verse 106 of this sûrah.\n384] This verse talks exclusively about the disbelievers at war with Muslims.\nSee 2:190-193 and 60:8-9.\n\n-- 632 of 694 --\n\n[385] i.e., hypocrites.\n[386] Their hypocrisy is exposed over and over again.\n[387] See footnote for 7:54.\n388] When they pray against themselves or their children, or when they\ndemand to be destroyed.\n[389] i.e., they split into believers and disbelievers.\n[390] That He will delay their judgment until the Hereafter.\n391] The pagans of Mecca were not satisfied with the literary miracle of the\nQuran, so they demanded a tangible miracle such as the staff of Moses.\n[392] Paradise.\n[393] Seeing Almighty Allah in the Hereafter.\n[394] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[395] This refers metaphorically to the pagans who fail to see and hear the\ntruth.\n[396] i.e., only for a short period of time.\n397] Either in this life to deliver the message or on the Day of Judgment to\ntestify for or against them.\n[398] This refers to 6:138-139.\n399] By delaying their punishment and allowing them time to repent.\n400] See footnote for 6:38.\n[401] The Christians, pagans, etc.\n402] Jesus in Christianity, the angels in pagan Arab mythology, etc.\n403] Moses prayed while Aaron said, “Amen.” So it is as if both of them\nprayed.\n[404] lit., sign.\n405] In Egypt, Jerusalem, and other places.\n406] They did not split into believers and disbelievers until they received the\nknowledge given to their prophets.\n407] When these verses were revealed, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) responded, “I am\nnot in doubt and I will not ask ˹anyone˺.”\n408] Initially, the people of Jonah rejected his message. When he was told\nthey would be punished after three days for their defiance, he left his city\nwithout Allah’s permission before its destruction. Jonah’s people became\nconvinced that they were going to be destroyed when he left them and\n\n-- 633 of 694 --\n\nthey saw signs of the imminent torment, so they felt remorseful and cried\nout for forgiveness before the coming of the punishment. Therefore,\nAllah accepted their repentance and the torment was retracted.\n409] i.e., until the end of their term.\n410] The hypocrites or the disbelievers.\n411] See footnote for 10:61.\n412] See footnote for 7:54.\n413] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n414] i.e., the angels and the prophets.\n415] Typically, the poor and the helpless are the first to believe in prophets,\ntaking them as saviours, whereas the rich and powerful are hesitant to\nbelieve, perceiving the new faith as a threat to their influence.\n416] Mercy here means prophethood.\n417] Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n418] Noah was given a signal that once the water gushes out of a particular\noven then the Flood is about to begin. It can also be translated as: “The\nfountains of the earth gushed forth.”\n419] lit., there is no moving creature that He does not hold by its forelock.\n420] lit., my Lord is on the Straight Path.\n[421] Disobey Hûd was an act of disobedience to all messengers.\n422] They believed that Ṣâliḥ had the potential to be their future leader.\n423] The she-camel came out of a mountain as a sign for them.\n424] In ancient Middle Eastern culture, if a guest refused to eat the food\nprovided by their host, it was a sign of ill-will.\n425] She laughed after her husband was assured that the guests intended no\nharm or when she heard the news of the imminent destruction of the\nsinful people of Lot.\n426] Since the angels came in the form of handsome men, Lot was worried\nfor the dignity and safety of his guests among his people—not knowing\nthat they were angels.\n427] Single women of his community.\n428] Lot’s wife disbelieved in his message. It is believed that she is the one\nwho informed the people of Lot’s handsome guests.\n429] Geographically and chronologically.\n\n-- 634 of 694 --\n\n430] Sinful believers will eventually be removed from Hell after receiving\ntheir punishment.\n431] Except the time they spend on earth and in the grave, or except the time\nthe sinful believers spend in Hell before being transferred to Paradise.\n432] That He will delay their judgment until the Hereafter.\n433] This verse talks about the five daily prayers. The prayers at the two ends\nof the day are the dawn prayer (Fajr) at one end and the afternoon\nprayers (\nẒuhr and ’A\nṣr) at the other. Prayers in the early part of the night\ninclude the sunset (Maghrib) and late evening (’Ishâ') prayers.\n434] Quran literally means recitation.\n435] The address here is to the Arabs and, by extension, all of humanity.\n436] This dream came true at the end of the story (see 12:100).\n437] Unlike Joseph’s other brothers, Benjamin was Joseph’s full brother. They\nlost their mother at a young age, so their half-brothers thought that their\nfather loved them more.\n438] They stained Joseph’s shirt with blood from a sheep, but forgot to tear\nhis shirt. So Jacob became suspicious when he saw the intact shirt.\n439] i.e., patience without complaining.\n440] Other possible translations: 1. “… so little did they value him.” 2. “…\nthey had no interest in him.” In any case, they wanted to sell him\nimmediately before someone claimed him. According to some Quran\ncommentators, it was Joseph’s brothers who sold him to the travellers\nafter he was picked up from the well. The verse states that Joseph was\nsold for a few worthless coins. Ironically, in 12:88 Joseph’s brothers\ncame to him after he became Egypt’s Chief Minister, begging for supplies\nand saying that the only money they could afford was a few worthless\ncoins. This is when Joseph revealed his true identity to them.\n441] Potiphar, the Chief Minister of Egypt (Al-’Azîz).\n442] Joseph (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received warning against fornication either through\ndivine inspiration or a vision of his father.\n443] She was urged to seek forgiveness from her husband.\n444] The women’s only objection was because the wife of the Chief Minister\nwas in love with someone raised in her house like a son.\n\n-- 635 of 694 --\n\n445] lit., ‘their cunning’ because the women themselves were probably\ninterested in Joseph.\n446] The women were cutting fruit, and when Joseph came out they were so\nimpressed by his beauty that they sliced through the fruit and into their\nhands without knowing.\n447] The women tried to convince him to obey the Chief Minister’s wife, so\nJoseph prayed to Allah to keep him away from them.\n448] To stop women from being charmed by Joseph’s beauty, or to put an end\nto the rumours, or to keep him away from the Minister’s wife.\n449] Meaning, “You call them gods while in fact they are not gods.”\n[450] The King of Egypt.\n451] In the Bible (the Book of Genesis), this ruler is referred to as a pharaoh,\nwhile in the Quran he is referred to as a king. Typically, Egypt was ruled\nby pharaohs, but there existed a brief period in Egyptian history in which\nEgypt was ruled by the Hyksos invaders (1700-1550 B.C.E.). Hyksos\nrulers were called kings, not pharaohs. Joseph entered Egypt during the\nreign of the Hyksos, who used to appoint some foreigners to prominent\npositions in Egypt. According to The Jewish Encyclopedia, “Those who\nregard the Joseph stories as historical generally hold that the Pharaoh by\nwhom Joseph was made the practical ruler of Egypt was one of the\nHyksos kings.” \"Joseph,\" The Jewish Encyclopedia, Volume VII\n(London: Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1916), p. 252.\n452] Joseph’s family was affected by famine, so they had to travel to Egypt to\nbuy supplies.\n453] i.e., Benjamin. When Joseph hosted his half-brothers, they told him the\nnumber of people in their household for future supplies.\n454] He told them that every three or four of them should enter through a\ndifferent gate. His desire was to protect them from envy and harm.\n455] The King’s cup was also used as the standard measure for grain.\n456] Joseph was falsely accused of theft when he was young.\n457] He meant: I did not steal anything, nor did my brother ˹Benjamin˺. You\nare the real thieves; you stole me from my father and threw me into the\nwell.\n\n-- 636 of 694 --\n\n458] We did not know when we gave you our solemn oath that our brother\nwas going to steal.\n[459] i.e., patience without complaining.\n460] Jacob (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) cried for so long that he became very weak-sighted.\nSome scholars suggest that he lost his sight completely. This does not\ncontradict Jacob’s beautiful patience because he did not complain to\nanyone, but expressed his sorrow only to Allah.\n461] Jacob (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) delayed the prayer for his children to be forgiven until\npre-dawn, which is a blessed time for supplication.\n462] Joseph’s parents and his eleven brothers prostrated before him out of\nrespect, not as an act of worship. This was permissible in their tradition,\nbut in Islam, Muslims prostrate only to Allah.\n463] Joseph (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) did not mention how Allah saved him from the well\nbecause he did not want to embarrass his brothers after forgiving them.\n[464] lit., as a Muslim.\n465] This includes Joseph’s brothers, the travellers who picked him up from\nthe well and sold him into slavery, and the Chief Minister’s wife and\nother women in the city.\n[466] Males and females, sweet and bitter, etc.\n[467] Like the staff of Moses.\n468] He knows whether the egg will be fertilized or not, whether the baby\nwill be born before or after nine months, whether the pregnancy will end\nwith delivery or miscarriage, and whether there will be one baby or more.\n[469] Hope of rain and fear of torment.\n470] lit., prostrate. Meaning, all beings submit to His Will.\n471] Blindness and darkness are commonly used as an analogy for disbelief,\nwhereas the ability to see and light refer to true faith in Allah.\n[472] lit., seeking their Lord’s Face.\n[473] i.e., the Hellfire.\n474] The disbelievers demanded a tangible miracle such as the staff of Moses.\n[475] See 17:110 and 25:60.\n476] See footnote for 6:38.\n477] This can mean that the disbelievers bit their own hands in rage, or they\ncovered their own mouths mockingly, or that they put their hands over\n\n-- 637 of 694 --\n\ntheir messengers’ mouths to silence them.\n478] It is out of Allah’s mercy that He does not hasten your punishment but\ndelays your death until your destined time.\n479] On the Day of Judgment, when the wicked realize that they are doomed,\nthey will blame Satan for their great loss and will plead to him to do\nwhatever he can to rescue them from the Hellfire. Satan will then stand\nup and deliver the speech quoted in this verse.\n480] That there is only one God worthy of worship.\n481] In this context, “humankind” refers only to those who deny Allah’s\nfavours.\n482] Arab traders used to pass by the homes of some destroyed nations on\ntheir journeys to Syria and Yemen (such as ’Ȃd and Thamûd,\nrespectively), stopping shortly for rest.\n[483] lit., had been Muslims.\n[484] i.e., the Quran.\n485] Some jinn used to eavesdrop on the angels in heaven so they could\ndisclose this information to their human associates. But this practice\ncame to an end when the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was sent with the message of\nIslam. See 72:8-10.\n486] Allah will remain eternally after all pass away.\n487] This does not contradict other verses that say Adam was created out of\ndust and those that say he was made out of mud. Adam was created in\nstages: first from dust, which was later turned into mud, then clay. This is\nsimilar to saying: I made a loaf of bread out of grain, or flour, or dough.\n[488] See footnote for 2:34.\n489] i.e., the bitterness they had in their hearts towards other believers who\nwronged them in the worldly life.\n490] As mentioned in 11:69-70, the angels came to Abraham in the form of\nmen and when he offered them food, they did not eat. In ancient Middle\nEastern culture, if a guest refused to eat the food provided by their host, it\nwas a sign of ill-will.\n[491] Single women of his community.\n492] This is the only time in the Quran where Allah swears by the life of a\nhuman being. Elsewhere Allah swears by the sun, the moon, the stars,\n\n-- 638 of 694 --\n\nand other marvels of His creation.\n493] lit., messengers, because denying Ṣâliḥ (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was equal to denying\nall of Allah’s messengers.\n[494] Sûrah 1 of the Quran.\n[495] i.e., lit., what is certain—death.\n496] The verse refers to the diverse creatures that have been created for the\nservice of humanity.\n497] This verse refers to a tyrant king who ordered the building of a tower so\nhe can reach the heavens and fight Allah and the angels. Eventually the\ntower collapsed, leaving the tyrant crushed.\n[498] lit., prostrates.\n[499] The angels.\n500] Some pagan Arabs used to bury their infant daughters alive for fear of\nshame or poverty. This practice was condemned and abolished by Islam.\nSee 6:151 and 81:8-9.\n501] They say that Allah has daughters (i.e., the angels), although they\nthemselves do not like to have daughters.\n[502] lit., pleasant for those who drink.\n503] Intoxicants were later prohibited in the Quran in three stages: 2:219,\n4:43, and finally 5:90-91.\n504] In other words, if the pagan slave-masters are not willing to be equal to\ntheir slaves, why would they make anyone equal to Allah—the Supreme\nMaster and Creator of all things?\n505]\nḤafadah means grandchildren, but can also mean children-in-law.\n506] The two parables emphasize that Almighty Allah masterfully conducts\nthe affairs of the heavens and the earth, whereas false gods are incapable\nof anything. If this is the case, these gods are not His equal and He is the\nonly one worthy of worship.\n507] He guides those who are sincere in their quest for guidance.\n[508] See footnote for 2:106.\n[509] The angel Gabriel.\n510] Some Meccan pagans claimed that the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received the\nQuran from a non-Arab slave owned by an Arab pagan.\n\n-- 639 of 694 --\n\n511] This refers to ’Ammâr ibn Yâsser, an early revert to Islam, who was\ntortured to leave Islam. To save his life, ’Ammâr pretended to denounce\nIslam, but his heart was full of faith. When he told the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nabout what happened, this verse was revealed, reassuring him that his\nfaith was intact.\n[512] See footnote for 2:173.\n[513] What is mentioned in 6:146.\n514] i.e., honourable mention and a righteous family.\n515] This verse refers to the Jews who claimed that Abraham was Jewish. See\n3:65-68.\n516] Al-Isrâ' refers to the Prophet’s Night Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem\nabout a year before his emigration (or Hijrah) from Mecca to Medina.\nThis journey came as a comfort for the Prophet after several years of\nhardship and persecution, which included a 3-year siege by Meccan\npagans, who drove the Muslims out of the city and forbade anyone from\ntrading, marrying, or feeding them. This was followed by the “Year of\nSadness,” which included the death of the Prophet’s uncle Abu Ṭâlib, the\nmajor defender of Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) despite his disbelief in his\nmessage, as well as the death of the Prophet’s beloved wife Khadîjah.\nThe Prophet was carried overnight by a noble steed (called Burâq) from\nMecca to Jerusalem where he met some earlier prophets and led them in\nprayer. He was later carried to the heavens (this journey is called Al-\nMi’râj, or the Ascension) where he received direct orders from Allah to\nobserve five daily prayers. The Ascension is referred to in 53:13–18.\n[517] i.e., Allah.\n518] Some people are quick to pray against themselves or others in times of\nanger and frustration.\n519] This refers to the deeds that one is destined to do of their own free will.\nOut of His infinite knowledge, Allah knows people’s choices even before\nthey make them. In the Hereafter, He will raise them from the dead for\njudgment.\n520] For example, in retaliation for intentional killing through legal channels.\n521] Here the word wali, “heir,” actually means awliyâ' or “heirs,” which\nincludes the closest relatives, both men and women.\n522] By killing anyone other than the killer, or killing others with the killer.\n\n-- 640 of 694 --\n\n523] Some pagans had the belief that the angels are the daughters of Allah.\n524] They rejected you as a magician, a poet, a fabricator, and madman.\n525] When everyone is raised from the dead, they will all praise Allah,\nregardless of what they had believed in this life.\n526] The reason David is singled out here is because some Jewish authorities\nat the time of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) claimed that no scripture had been\nrevealed after Moses. So this verse refutes this claim by referring to the\nPsalms of David.\n527] i.e., Jesus, Ezra, and the angels. Idol worship is refuted in other passages\nsuch as 7:191-198 and 34:22.\n[528] Or they did wrong by it.\n529] During the Night Journey mentioned in 17:1.\n530] The tree of Zaqqûm which grows in the depths of Hell as mentioned in\n37:62-65. The pagans of Mecca used to make fun of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nand say, “How can a tree grow in Hell?”\n[531] See footnote for 2:34.\n532] Other meanings include: with their record of deeds, or their prophet, or\ntheir scripture.\n533] The pagans of Mecca tried in vain to dissuade the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) from\npreaching the message of Islam. In some instances they offered to\nworship his Allah if he agreed to bow to their idols, and some even\noffered him riches and positions if he just stopped preaching in the city.\n534] This verse gives the times of the five daily prayers: the decline of the sun\nrefers to the afternoon and late afternoon prayers, the darkness of night\nrefers to sunset and late evening prayers, then the dawn prayer.\n535] This refers to the time when the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) will make intercession\n(shafâ’ah) on the Day of Judgment.\n536] This verse was revealed when the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received the order to\nemigrate from Mecca to Medina. So here he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is praying to leave\nMecca honourably and enter Medina honourably. It can also apply to any\nworldly activity that a person starts and finishes.\n537] The nine signs of Moses are: the staff, the hand (both mentioned in\n20:17-22), famine, shortage of crops, floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and\nblood (all mentioned in 7:130-133). These signs came as proofs for\n\n-- 641 of 694 --\n\nPharaoh and the Egyptians. Otherwise, Moses had some other signs such\nwater gushing out of the rock after he hit it with his staff, and splitting the\nsea.\n538] This may also refer to the second warning in 17:7.\n[539] i.e., the faithful among the scholars of the Torah and the Gospel.\n[540] i.e., Jesus, Ezra, or the angels.\n[541] i.e., another god equal to Him.\n[542] i.e., the idols.\n[543] Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n544] i.e., Jesus in Christianity and the angels in the pagan Arab traditions.\n545] Ar-Raqîm is the plaque that was placed at the entrance of the cave with\nthe names and story of the People of the Cave. This is the story of a\ngroup of Christian youths who hid inside a cave outside the city of\nEphesus around 250 C.E., to escape persecution at the hands of pagans\nduring the reign of the Roman emperor Decius. The Quran does not give\nan exact number of the youths, although many scholars believe there\nwere seven in addition to a dog. The youths slept for 300 years, plus nine\n(300 solar years equal 309 lunar years).\n546] lit., We cast a cover of ˹deep˺ sleep over their ears.\n547] The People of the Cave themselves disagreed on how long they had slept\nin the cave. See 18:19.\n548] While they slept in the open space of the cave, fresh air blew through the\ncave, but they were protected from the heat of the sun.\n549] This is because, during their long sleep, their eyes were open, their hair\ngrew long, and their bodies rolled over to the right and left to prevent\nbedsores.\n550] Their antique silver coins gave them away. People rushed to the cave to\ngreet the youths, who finally passed away and were buried in the cave.\nThe King decided to build a place of worship at the cave to\ncommemorate their story.\n551] Some pagans suggested that a wall should be built to seal off the cave,\nwhereas the believers decided to build a place of worship at the cave to\nhonour those youths.\n552] Based on what has been revealed in the Quran.\n\n-- 642 of 694 --\n\n553] Three hundred years in the Gregorian calendar equal three hundred and\nnine years in the Islamic lunar calendar.\n[554] lit., seeking His Face.\n555] The word “thamar” can mean fruits, gold and silver, etc.\n[556] Created your father, Adam, from dust.\n557] This refers to good deeds that will benefit the believer in the Hereafter\nsuch as prayers or praises of Allah such as saying: ‘Subḥâna-Allâh’\n(Glory be to Allah), ‘Al\nḥamdulillâh’ (Praise be to Allah), ‘Lâ ilâha illa-\nAllâh’ (There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Allah), and ‘Allâhu\nakbar’ (Allah is the Greatest).\n[558] See footnote for 2:34.\n[559] i.e., the peoples of ’Ȃd and Thamûd.\n560] It is reported in an authentic narration collected by Bukhâri that a man\napproached Moses after he gave a talk and asked him, “Who is the most\nknowledgeable person on earth?” Moses responded, “That would be me!”\nSo Allah revealed to Moses that he should not have said this and there\nwas in fact someone who was more knowledgeable than him. Moses was\ncommanded to travel to meet this man, named Al-Khaḍir, at the junction\nof the two seas (which could be the northern part of Sinai between the\nRed Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, or the Southern part of Sinai where\nthe Red Sea splits into the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba).\n561] Another possible translation: “The ˹salted˺ fish must have made its way\ninto the sea. How strange!”\n562] Moses was given a sign: when he and his assistant Joshua (or Yûsha’ ibn\nNûn) lost their food (a salted fish), this would be the place where they\nwould find the man of knowledge.\n[563] This is the royal ‘we’.\n564] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) commented on the story, “I wish Moses had been\nmore patient so we can learn more from that wise man.”\n5 6 5 ] This is the story of a righteous king who travelled far and wide. He is\ntitled Ⱬul-Qarnain (lit., the man of the two horns) because of his journeys\nto the far east and far west (or the two horns/points of sunrise and sunset).\nSome believe Ⱬul-Qarnain was Alexander the Great, but this is not sound\n\n-- 643 of 694 --\n\nsince Alexander the Great was a polytheist. Many scholars believe it was\nAbu Kuraib Al-Ḥamiri, a righteous king from Yemen.\n566] They either had no clothes or homes to protect them from the sun.\n567] Gog and Magog are two wild peoples who were sealed off by a barrier\nbuilt by Ⱬul-Qarnain to stop them from raiding their peaceful neighbours.\nThere are many speculations as to their location, but none is supported by\nreliable sources. Their coming out is mentioned in 21:96-97 as one of the\nmajor signs of the final Hour.\n[568] Gog and Magog.\n569] On the Day of Judgment, the Trumpet will be blown by an angel—\ncausing all to die. When it is blown a second time, everyone will be\nraised from the dead to be assembled for the Judgment (see 39:68).\n570] i.e., the Quran.\n[571] i.e., Jesus, Ezra, and the angels.\n[572] Al-Firdaws, the highest place in Paradise.\n573] This was the voice of baby Jesus. Some say it was Gabriel.\n574] lit., fast ˹from speech˺. Linguistically,\t\nṣawm means to abstain from\nsomething, such as food, speaking, and playing.\n575] i.e., his twin in virtue. They meant that they did not expect her to do\nsomething like that because they held her in high esteem like Aaron,\nMoses’ brother (perhaps because she was his descendant).\n576] On a daily basis, Muslims invoke Allah’s blessings upon Prophet\nMuḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his family and Prophet Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and\nhis family, in both obligatory and optional prayers.\n577] Prophet Enoch (Idrîs) (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is said to be in the fourth heaven.\n578] Israel is another name for Jacob (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n579] The word ghai can either mean the evil consequences or a valley in Hell\nwhere they will be punished.\n580] There is no day or night in Paradise, only light. The verse says that the\nresidents of Paradise will either be receiving provisions around these\nworldly times or without failure. Words such as morning and evening are\nused to make it easier for the people to understand.\n581] This passage is a response to the Prophet’s request to be visited by\nGabriel more often.\n\n-- 644 of 694 --\n\n582] This refers to the bridge (known as A\nṣ-\nṢirâ\nṭ) which is extended over\nHell. Both the believers and disbelievers will be made to cross that\nbridge. The believers will cross it safely, each at a different speed\naccording to the strength of their faith, whereas the disbelievers and the\nhypocrites will plunge into the Fire.\n583] See footnote for 18:46.\n584] This statement was made by Al-’Ȃṣ ibn Wâ'il, a Meccan pagan who\nstaunchly disbelieved in resurrection.\n585] No one will be allowed to intercede except those who firmly believe in\nAlmighty Allah.\n586] The pagans who claimed that the angels are Allah’s daughters, the\nChristians who claim that Jesus is the son of Allah, etc.\n587] Moses and his family lost their way in the dark while they were\ntravelling from Midian to Egypt.\n588] Moses could have just said, “A staff.” But he volunteered to talk about\nthe uses of the staff, adding that there are many other uses he has not\nmentioned, with the hope that Allah would ask him about it more. The\nreason is that Moses wanted to prolong the conversation with Allah as\nmuch as he could.\n589] Moses, who was dark-skinned, was asked to put his hand under his\narmpit. When he took it out it was shining white, but not out of a skin\ncondition like melanoma.\n590] Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) put a brand of fire in his mouth, which hindered his\nspeech as he grew up. In this verse, he prays to Allah to help him speak\nclearly, and his prayer is answered.\n591] In other words, Allah made Moses a likeable person so Pharaoh and his\nwife would agree to keep him.\n592] Moses had refused all wet-nurses that were brought for him.\n593] See footnote for 17:101.\n594] By saying that Moses’ miracle is pure magic.\n595] i.e., your prophet to receive the Tablets for your guidance.\n596] Manna (heavenly bread) and quails (chicken-like birds) sustained the\nchildren of Israel in the wilderness after they left Egypt.\n\n-- 645 of 694 --\n\n597] Moses selected a delegation of seventy people from his community to go\nto Mount Ṭûr where it was appointed for him to receive the Tablets. On\nthe way, he rushed for the appointment with Allah, arriving before the\ndelegation.\n598] The Sâmiri, or the man from Samaria, was a hypocrite who led the\nChildren of Israel into idol-worship.\n[599] To reveal the Torah for their guidance.\n600] To worship Allah alone until Moses returned with the Tablets.\n601] The jewellery they borrowed from their Egyptian neighbours before they\nfled Egypt.\n602] Moses’ orders are mentioned in 7:142.\n603] This verse could also be translated as follows: “I had an insight which\nthey did not have, then grasped some knowledge from the messenger\n˹Moses˺, but ˹later˺ threw it away. This is what my lower-self tempted me\nto do.” According to many Quran commentators, while Moses and the\nChildren of Israel were crossing the sea to escape abuse by Pharaoh and\nhis people, the Sâmiri saw Gabriel on a horse leading the way, and every\ntime the horse touched the ground, it turned green. So the Sâmiri took a\nhandful of dust from the hoof-prints of the horse, and later tossed it at the\ncalf so it started to make a lowing sound.\n604] Meaning, alienated in the dessert, away from the people.\n[605] lit., destined time.\n[606] The Quran.\n607] See footnote for 18:99.\n608] This can also mean “blind.”\n[609] This can also mean “footsteps.”\n610] Allah fully knows what fate awaits them and what they did in the world.\n[611] Or “… they cannot encompass His knowledge.”\n612] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was eager to recite the Quran while it was being\nrevealed to him through the angel Gabriel. So he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was told to\ntake his time to learn it by heart once the verses are properly delivered to\nhim.\n[613] See footnote for 2:34.\n614] There is no sun or cold weather in Paradise, only light. See 76:13.\n\n-- 646 of 694 --\n\n615] Unlike the Bible (Genesis 3), the Quran does not blame Eve for Adam’s\nfall from the Garden.\n[616] The Reminder is another name for the Quran.\n[617] That He will delay their judgment until the Hereafter.\n618] This verse refers to the times of the five daily prayers.\n619] The pagans of Mecca were not satisfied with a literary miracle in the\nform of the Quran, so they asked for a tangible miracle (see 17:90-91)\nsimilar to the staff of Moses.\n620] This either refers to the Biblical stories confirmed by the Quran or the\nprophecies of Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the Bible. Some Muslim scholars\ncite Deuteronomy 18:15-18 and 33:2, Isaiah 42, and John 14:16 as\nexamples of the description of Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the\nBible. However, Bible scholars interpret these verses differently.\n[621] lit., extinguished like ashes.\n[622] That Allah has a partner and children.\n623] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is ordered to challenge the pagans to produce\nlogical and scriptural proofs for the existence of other gods beside Allah.\nThe verses then argue that if there is more than one god, the different\ngods would have fought among themselves for domination, and the\nwhole universe would have been ruined. The Quran, the Torah, and the\nGospel are all in agreement that there is only One God.\n624] Some pagans claimed that the angels are Allah’s daughters.\n[625] This probably refers to the event commonly known as the Big Bang.\n626] The signs of the heaven include the galaxies, planets, stars, etc., all of\nwhich have an orbit. Our planet orbits the sun, the sun orbits the Milky\nWay Galaxy, and the Milky Way Galaxy orbits the Virgo Supercluster,\netc.\n627] This can also mean that they are in awe of their Lord as much in private\nas they are in public.\n628] It is reported in a\nḥadîth collected by Bukhâri that Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nsaid, while being thrown into the fire, “Allah ˹alone˺ is sufficient ˹as an\naid˺ for us and ˹He˺ is the best Protector.”\n629] Abraham and his nephew, Lot, migrated from Babel, Iraq to Jerusalem.\n[630] i.e., the believers in his family.\n\n-- 647 of 694 --\n\n631] A man’s flock of sheep strayed into another man’s vineyard, eating and\ndestroying all his produce. When the two men came to David for\njudgment, he ruled that the shepherd must give his animals to the\nvineyard owner in compensation for the damage. On their way out, the\ntwo men met young Solomon and the shepherd complained to him.\nSolomon discussed the case with his father, and suggested that the sheep\nshould be kept with the man who lost his produce so he may benefit from\ntheir milk and wool, while the shepherd worked on the farm to restore it\nto its original state. Eventually the famer would take back his farm in\nperfect condition, and the sheep would be returned to the shepherd. David\nwas impressed by his son’s insight and approved his fair judgment\nimmediately.\n[632] lit., devils.\n[633] The jinn dived to bring him pearls.\n634] This refers to his loss of health, wealth, and children.\n635] Scholars are in disagreement as to whether Ⱬul-Kifl was a prophet or\njust a righteous man. Those who maintain that he was a prophet identify\nhim with various Biblical prophets such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Obadiah.\n636] Or “thinking We will let him get away with it.” Jonah (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had been\nmet with denial for many years. When he sensed the coming of Allah’s\ntorment, he abandoned his city without Allah’s permission. Eventually,\nhis people repented before the coming of the torment, and Allah accepted\ntheir repentance (see 10:98), whereas Jonah ended up in the belly of the\nwhale (see 37:140-148).\n637] The darkness of the night, the sea, and the belly of the whale.\n638] Meaning, “You will be there for eternity after all pass away.”\n639] Gabriel breathed into the sleeves of Mary’s garment so she conceived\nJesus.\n[640] See 18:93-99.\n641] i.e., the Final Hour.\n642] See footnote for 43:57-58.\n643] This refers to Psalm 37:29: “The righteous shall inherit the land.” See\nfootnote for 39:47.\n\n-- 648 of 694 --\n\n[644] Meaning, “We seek Allah’s help against your claims that He has\npartners ˹in worship˺.”\n[645] Your father, Adam.\n646] Nu\nṭfah refers to the union of male and female gametes (sperm and egg)\nwhich results in the zygote after fertilization.\n[647] ’Alaqah, meaning the embryo resembles a leech.\n648] Mu\nḍghah, meaning it resembles a chewed morsel.\n649] Fully formed or defected, evolving into a healthy embryo or ending in\nmiscarriage.\n[650] lit., they tumble on their faces.\n651] Meaning, no matter what the deniers do, Allah will never stop\nsupporting His Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[652] See footnote for 2:62.\n[653] Magi (singular: magus): Zoroastrians; fire-worshippers.\n654] lit., prostrate. Meaning, all beings submit to His Will.\n655] Another possible translation: “… and they have been guided to the Path\nof the Praiseworthy ˹God˺.”\n656] This was revealed after the pagans of Mecca had refused to let the\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his companions proceed to the Sacred Mosque to\nperform the minor pilgrimage (’umrah), although they came all the way\nfrom Medina. Eventually, an agreement was made, stipulating that the\nMuslims return to Medina and come back the following year for ’umrah.\n[657] The Sacred Mosque is in Mecca.\n658] Generally, intending to do wrong does not necessitate a punishment,\nunless the person acts upon it. But the Sacred Mosque is unique in that\nintending to sin in it is sufficient to bring punishment from Allah, unless\nthe person repents.\n659] According to Ibn Kathîr, Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said to Allah, “But my voice\ncannot reach all peoples.” Allah responded, “You make the call, and We\nwill deliver the invitation to all.”\n660] Spiritual benefits such as prayers, pilgrimage, and forgiveness of sins, as\nwell as worldly benefits such as meeting Muslims from everywhere and\ntrading.\n661] Shaving their hair, clipping nails, and taking a shower.\n\n-- 649 of 694 --\n\n[662] See 5:3.\n[663] Milking or riding them until the time for sacrifice.\n664] For over thirteen years, Muslims had not been allowed to fight back\nagainst the brutality of the Meccan pagans, leading to the emigration of\nthe Prophet and many of his companions to Medina. As the hostilities\ncontinued, this verse was later revealed allowing Muslims to fight back in\nself-defence.\n665] The Day ˹of Judgment˺ is described as ’aqîm (lit., barren) because it will\nterminate all forms of life on earth and no new day will be born.\n666] Allah grants authority to some of His servants in this world, but none\nwill have authority on Judgment Day except Him. See 3:26.\n[667] For your service.\n\n-- 650 of 694 --\n\n668] All prophets came with the same message: have faith in one God and do\ngood. But each faith-community had their own law.\n669] The Muslim code of life is called Sharî’ah, which means a “path.” For\nmore information, see the Introduction.\n670] Another possible translation: “How weak are the seekers (i.e., the idols)\nand the sought (i.e., the fly)!”\n[671] i.e., Muslims.\n672] Zakâh means purification and growth. Paying alms-tax and charity are\nforms of purifying one’s wealth.\n673] lit., private parts.\n[674] See footnote for 4:3.\n[675] Al-Firdaws, the highest place in Paradise.\n[676] Adam (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n677] See footnote for 22:5.\n678] This happens when the spirit is breathed into the embryo.\n[679] So he may recover from his “madness” or die.\n680] Noah was given a signal that once the water gushes out of a particular\noven then the Flood is about to begin. It can also be translated as: “The\nfountains of the earth gushed forth.”\n[681] lit., signs.\n682] Some scholars believe this passage refers to Prophet Ṣâliḥ (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n683] The nine signs are: the staff, the hand (both mentioned in 20:17-22),\nfamine, shortage of crops, floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood (all\nmentioned in 7:130-133).\n684] It is reported in an authentic narration collected by At-Tirmiⱬi that\n’Ȃishah, the Prophet’s wife, asked him (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) if this verse refers to\nthose who steal or drink ˹alcohol˺. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) answered, “No,\nit refers to those who pray, fast, and donate, but are afraid that their deeds\nare rejected because they are not good enough.” Then he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) recited\nthe last part of the verse: “It is they who race to do good deeds, always\ntaking the lead.”\n685] This refers to the believers’ good deeds mentioned in 23:57-62.\n686] Their desire that the universe has more than one God. See 21:22.\n687] This refers to famine which affected the pagans of Mecca.\n\n-- 651 of 694 --\n\n[688] The Meccan pagans.\n689] Their claims that there are many gods, and that the Prophet is a liar, a\npoet, etc.\n690] Meaning, once they are dead, they will never return to the world.\n691] On the Day of Judgment, the Trumpet will be blown by an angel—\ncausing all to die. When it is blown a second time, everyone will be\nraised from the dead for judgment (see 39:68).\n692] Everyone will be busy with their own situation.\n693] Compared to the length and misery of their stay in the grave and Hell,\ntheir worldly life will seem very short to them.\n694] The address here is to legal authorities. Adultery has to be proven either\nby confession or the testimony of four reliable witnesses.\n695] It is reported in a\nḥadîth collected by At-Tirmiⱬi that Marthad ibn Abi\nMarthad, a companion of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), asked if he could marry\n’Anâq, a pagan prostitute he befriended in Mecca before he accepted\nIslam. So this verse was revealed. However, if someone committed a sin\nthen later repented genuinely, they will be accepted by Allah and the rest\nof the believers.\n696] In order to be spared the punishment for false accusation.\n697] This ruling is called li’ân in Islamic legal system. Once the husband and\nthe wife swear each five times, as specified in 24:6-9, the marriage is\nterminated forever—which means that they can never be remarried.\n698] This is referring to an incident where the Prophet’s wife, ’Ȃishah, was\naccused of adultery. She was part of a caravan, and when she lost her\nnecklace and went looking for it, the caravan moved on without her. She\nwaited until a man named Ṣafwân ibn Al-Mu’aṭṭal found her and\nescorted her to the caravan. When they returned, the hypocrites began\naccusing her of adultery. The rumour spread, and ’Ȃishah defended her\ninnocence, saying “If I told you now I had not done this, you would not\nbelieve me. And if I told you that I had done it, you would believe me. I\nnow say what Jacob had once said. He said (12:18): ‘˹I can only endure\nwith˺ beautiful patience! It is Allah’s help that I seek to bear your\nclaims.’” Right after she said this, these verses were revealed to the\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), proclaiming her innocence.\n699] Because now you can tell who is a true believer and who is a hypocrite.\n\n-- 652 of 694 --\n\n700] This refers to ’Abdullâh ibn Ubai, the leader of the hypocrites in\nMedina.\n701] This verse was revealed when Abu Bakr Aṣ-Ṣiddîq, ’Ȃishah’s father,\nswore to end his financial assistance to his poor cousin, Misṭaḥ ibn\nAthathah, for taking part in the rumours against ’Ȃishah. Once the verse\nwas revealed, Abu Bakr resumed his assistance to Misṭaḥ.\n702] Immoral thoughts never cross the minds of these chaste women and,\ntherefore, they never expect slander.\n703] This passage declares the innocence of ’Ȃishah, the Prophet’s wife.\n[704] lit., non-residential buildings.\n[705] i.e., hair, body shape, and underclothes.\n706] i.e., the face, hands, outer clothes, rings, kohl, and henna.\n[707] i.e., hair, arms, and legs.\n708] Meaning, if a slave wants to buy his or her own freedom.\n709] Some slave-masters used to force their slave-women into prostitution\nbefore Islam. In Islam, wilful prostitution is a sin, as is forcing others into\nprostitution. Victims of this crime are not held accountable.\n710] Before ’Ȃishah, Mary and Prophet Joseph had each been falsely accused\nof fornication, but Almighty Allah declared their innocence.\n711] This is a metaphor for the light of guidance in the heart of the believer.\n712] Meaning, the olive tree is wholesome because it is located in a central\nplace, so it is hit by sunrays all day-long, and, therefore, the oil is of a\npremium quality.\n[713] See footnote for 7:46.\n714] This is another scientific fact mentioned in the Quran: the existence of\nunderwater waves, like layers.\n[715] Those at fault.\n716] This is used in a sarcastic way. It means, “Save your oaths! Everyone\nknows you are only bluffing. It is actions that matter, not words.”\n[717] The Prophet’s only duty is to deliver the message.\n718] Their only duty is to obey the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) by submitting to Allah.\n719] There is no blame on any of the three if they do not march forth in\nAllah’s cause. Moreover, some Muslims would give the keys of their\nhomes to one of those who could not march forth (namely the blind, the\n\n-- 653 of 694 --\n\ndisabled, or the sick) or their own relatives and ask them to enter their\nhouses and eat at will but these people were shy to do that.\n720] i.e., the home of your spouse or children.\n721] If someone is in the house, greet them by saying, ‘As-salâmu ’alaikum’\n(peace be upon you).” But if there is no one there, you greet yourselves\nby saying, ‘Asalâmu ’alaina wa ’ala ’ibâd-illâhi aṣ-\nṣâli\nḥîn’ (peace be\nupon us and all righteous servants of Allah).”\n722] There is also a different interpretation: “Do not call the Messenger ˹by\nhis name˺ as you call one another.” In other words, Do not say, ‘O\nMuḥammad.’ Rather, say, ‘O Prophet.’\n723] Some hypocrites used to sneak out while the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was\ntalking.\n724] Al-Furqân, which is one of names of the Quran, means \"the standard to\ndistinguish between right and wrong.\"\n[725] Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[726] For both humans and jinn.\n[727] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n728] Some Arab pagans claimed that the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had been taught\nthe Bible by some non-Arab Christians. The Quran itself (16:103) refutes\nthis claim by arguing that a non-Arab could not come up with an eloquent\nArabic scripture like the Quran when eloquent Arabs failed to produce\nsomething like it. For more details, see the Introduction.\n729] He forgives those who repent, and gives a grace period to those who do\nnot.\n730] i.e., a magician, a poet, a fabricator, and a madman.\n731] What they have said about you are only excuses to justify their denial of\nthe Hereafter.\n[732] e.g., Jesus and the angels.\n733] Another possible translation: “They will say, ‘Glory be to You! We\nwould not dare to take other lords besides You ˹so how can we claim to\nbe lords?˺’”\n734] Another possible translation: “And the angels will say, ‘All good is\nforbidden to you!’”\n\n-- 654 of 694 --\n\n735] The good deeds of the disbelievers (like charity) will have no weight on\nJudgment Day.\n736] Some people (like kings and rulers) have some sort of authority in this\nworld. But on Judgment Day Allah will be the sole authority.\n737] This passage refers to ’Oqbah ibn Abi-Mu’aiṭ who had initially become\nMuslim, but later left Islam only to please his close friend, Ubai ibn\nKhalaf.\n738] lit., messengers, because denying Noah was equal to denying all of\nAllah’s messengers.\n739] Ar-Rass means “well” or “water-pit”. This refers to a pagan people,\nalong with Midian, to whom Allah sent Prophet Shu’aib.\n740] They neither pay attention, nor think for themselves. They only follow\nothers blindly.\n741] Generally, animals are obedient and loyal to their masters who care for\nthem and they seem to know their way, whereas Meccan pagans are\ndisobedient and ungrateful to their Lord and Sustainer, choosing to stray\nfrom the right path.\n742] This means that one of the great miracles of Allah is that He allows the\nsun to rise in the morning, causing darkness to retreat. He could have\nstopped the sun and the earth from rotating, so half of the world would be\nengulfed in complete darkness, leading to an imbalance in the earth’s\neco-systems and endangering life on the planet.\n743] This refers to estuaries where salt and fresh waters meet forming\nbrackish water. Although both waters mix together, each still keeps its\ndistinctive qualities.\n[744] The mixture of sperm and egg.\n[745] See footnote for 7:54.\n[746] The sun.\n747] For example, in retaliation for intentional killing through legal channels.\n748] For killing an Egyptian by mistake before prophethood. See 28:15-17.\n[749] See previous footnote.\n[750] Pharaoh and his soldiers.\n751] It is reported in an authentic narration collected by At-Tirmiⱬi that\nProphet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said that Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) did not tell the\n\n-- 655 of 694 --\n\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص \tملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\nfull truth only on three different occasions: when he justified his absence\nfrom the pagan festival by saying ‘I am really sick’ (see 37:89), and when\nhe destroyed the idols and blamed it on the biggest one (see 21:63), and\nwhen he said that Sarah was his sister to save her from a tyrant ruler.\n752] On a daily basis, Muslims invoke Allah’s blessings upon Prophet\nMuḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his family and Prophet Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and\nhis family, in both obligatory and optional prayers.\n753] A pure and sound heart is that of the believer, compared to that of the\ndisbeliever and the hypocrite.\n[754] Iblîs was the name of Satan before his fall from grace. See footnote for\n2:34.\n755] lit., messengers, because denying Noah (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was equal to denying\nall of Allah’s messengers.\n756] The pagans were accusing the impoverished believers of following Noah\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) only for personal gain, not out of sincere faith.\n[757] lit., men of the world.\n[758] Lot’s wife, who betrayed her husband.\n759] Unlike other prophets in this sûrah who are identified as the brothers of\nfellow tribesmen, Shu’aib is not identified as the brother of the people of\nthe Aykah (which is the name of the forest where they used to worship a\nparticular tree) because they are identified by faith, rather than a tribal\nconnection.\n760] They were targeted by scorching heat, so they did not know where to go.\nFinally, a soothing cloud appeared in the sky, so they rushed to it for\nshade, then the cloud rained torment upon them, as they had requested.\n761] i.e., ’Abdullâh ibn Salâm, a Jewish authority, who accepted Islam during\nthe time of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[762] The devils can no longer eavesdrop on heaven.

Moses and his family lost their way in the dark while\nthey were travelling from Midian to Egypt.\n766] This refers to the angels who were present around the light.\n\n-- 656 of 694 --\n\n767] See footnote for 20:22.\n768] See footnote for 23:45.\n769] The privilege was their ability to communicate with members of the\nanimal kingdom, control the wind, utilize the jinn for their service, etc.\n770] The Queen of Sheba is known in Islamic tradition as Bilkis.\n771] She wanted to test Solomon (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to see if he was only a king (so he\nwould be satisfied with a tribute) or a prophet (who would only settle\nwith submission to the True God).\n[772] If they refuse to submit.\n773] To explain why Prophet Solomon brought the Queen’s magnificent\nthrone and built the marvellous palace, many traditional commentators\ncite some folkloric or legendary stories. However, none of these stories is\nsupported by reliable Islamic sources.\n774] This refers to ’Aṣif ibn Barkhiya, a knowledgeable and righteous\nassistant of Solomon.\n[775] Because he had refused her tribute.\n776] Bringing her well-guarded, mighty throne all the way from Sheba,\nYemen.\n[777] i.e., believers and disbelievers.\n[778] i.e., the evil.\n[779] i.e., the good.\n780] They were struck with famine, which they blamed on Ṣâliḥ and his\nfollowers.\n781] See footnote for 25:53.\n[782] Via the stars and constellations.\n[783] In the form of rain.\n784] This passage was revealed when the polytheists asked the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) about the time of the Final Hour.\n785] By delaying their punishment and allowing them time to repent.\n[786] Through their tongues or actions.\n787] The Record refers to the Preserved Tablet (Al-Law\nḥ Al-Ma\nḥfû\nẓ) in\nwhich Allah has written the destiny of His entire creation.\n788] The beast is believed to be one of the major signs of the Day of\nJudgment. No further details are given in reliable resources about this\n\n-- 657 of 694 --\n\nbeast.\n7 8 9 ] To demonstrate His ability to bring people back to life, Allah usually\nrefers to some wonders of His creation, such as the planets, the\nalternation of the day and night, the mountains, and the development of\nthe human embryo.\n790] The Trumpet will be blown at two different occasions, signalling the\nbeginning of Judgment Day. The first blow will cause all creation to die,\nexcept whoever Allah spares, and the second one will cause them to be\nraised from the dead.\n791] It is commonly believed that Hamân was in charge of architecture during\nthe reign of Pharaoh at the time of Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n792] The fulfilment of the Pharaoh’s old dream that his reign would come to\nan end at the hands of a boy from the Children of Israel.\n793] In his adulthood, Moses and Pharaoh’s people were not on good terms\nbecause he started to question their evil practices.\n794] The man assumed that Moses was going to hit him.\n795] Moses left Egypt with no food, money, or even shoes.

For example, the conspiracies that were made against\nJoseph (12:102), the dispute on who should be the guardian of young\nMary (3:44), and the drowning of Noah’s son in the Flood (11:49). These\ndetails were not known to Arabs before the revelation of the Quran. So\nthe only logical way that the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) knew about these stories is\nthrough divine revelation.\n800] So they neglected the Commandments over time.\n\n-- 658 of 694 --\n\n801] The pagans of Mecca demanded that the Quran should have been\nrevealed all at once like the Torah, and the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) should have\nhad some tangible signs like the staff of Moses.\n802] Some Meccan pagans approached some Jewish authorities to inquire\nabout the Prophet’s message and they were told that there are references\nof him in the Torah. So the pagans immediately rejected both the Torah\nand the Quran as two works of magic.\n[803] lit., ‘We had already been Muslims.’\n[804] By travellers such as the Meccan pagans.\n[805] A prophet.\n806] Korah was the cousin of Moses.

When he was asked repeatedly by Moses\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to pay his alms-tax to help poor Israelites, Korah refused and\neventually conspired with a prostitute to damage the reputation of Moses,\nbut Moses was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n807] Or: “I have been granted all this because I know that Allah knows I\ndeserve it.”\n808] Since their sins are already known to Allah and written in perfect\nrecords, they will only be interrogated as a form of punishment.\n809] This verse was revealed while the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was on the way to\nMedina, emigrating from Mecca after years of persecution. Eventually\nthe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) returned to Mecca and the majority of its people\naccepted Islam.\n[810] lit., except His Face.\n[811] Other gods.\n[812] The burdens of those they misled.\n[813] lit., My mercy.\n814] The idolaters tried to burn Abraham because he smashed their idols. See\n21:51-71 for the full story.\n[815] Through honourable mention, righteous family, etc.\n816] Since the angels came in the form of handsome men, Lot was worried\nfor the dignity and safety of his guests among his people—not knowing\nthat they were angels.\n\n-- 659 of 694 --\n\n817] Meccan caravans always passed by these ruins on the way to Yemen and\nSyria for business.\n818] Externally, the web is too flimsy to protect the spider against rain and\nstrong wind. Internally, the spider’s family structure is fragile, since some\nspecies are cannibalistic, with the female preying on the male and the\nyoung eating their own mother.\n819] They were not convinced of the Quran’s literary miracle and, therefore,\nasked for tangible signs similar to the staff of Moses.\n820] This passage addresses poor Muslims who were subject to persecution in\nMecca and had to move elsewhere. Some of them were worried that they\nwould not find provisions if they moved to a new place.\n821] Mecca was considered as a sanctuary. Therefore, fighting was not\nallowed there, and whoever entered Mecca (especially in the\nneighbourhood of the Ka’bah) was safe—a privilege that other cities in\nArabia did not have.\n[822] i.e., the false gods and idols.\n823] This can also mean “in the lowest part of the earth.” The Dead Sea area\nwhere this battle reportedly took place is the lowest point on earth, at 400\nmeters \t(1 \t300 \tfeet) \tbelow \tsea \tlevel. \tNASA:\nwww.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_708.html\n824] This verse outlines the times of the five daily prayers. The evening refers\nto Maghrib and ’Ishâ' prayers, the morning refers to Fajr, the afternoon\nrefers to ’A\nṣr, and noon refers to\nẒuhr.\n[825] Hope of rain and fear of torment.\n[826] lit., to Him.\n827] This is from a human perspective. Otherwise, both the creation of the\nuniverse and the resurrection of humans are easy for Allah.\n828] The passage says that since humans would not allow those who are\ninferior to them to become their partners in wealth, how can they set up\nhelpless partners with Allah in His kingdom?\n[829] lit., seek the Face of Allah.\n830] Another meaning is the gift given to someone with the intention of\ngetting a more expensive gift in return—a common ancient practice.\n[831] lit., grey hair.\n\n-- 660 of 694 --\n\n832] Some pagan Arabs used to utilize singing, dancing, chanting, etc. to\ndistract people’s attention from listening to the recitation of the Quran.\n8 3 3 ] Luqmân is believed to have been a righteous, wise man who lived\naround the time of Prophet David (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n8 3 4 ] The Quran usually combines the command to worship Allah with the\norder to honour one’s parents (see 6:151 and 17:23). This is why this\npassage interjects Luqmân’s advice to his son. In some instances, the\nQuran follows the order to be kind to parents with emphasizing the role\nof the mother. This is because some of the mother’s sacrifices take place\nbefore the child is born and when they are too young. So the Quran\nbrings these sacrifices to the children’s attention.\n[835] Other gods.\n[836] Satan.\n[837] See footnote for 6:59.\n838] He knows precisely when, where, and how much rain falls, and whether\nit is going to be drunk by people and animals or used for irrigation, or\nabsorbed by the earth, etc.\n839] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was reported in a\nḥadîth collected by Bukhâri and\nMuslim to have said, “Indeed, the creation of each one of you is brought\ntogether in the womb of one’s mother as a drop of ˹male and female˺\ndischarges for forty days, then one becomes a clinging clot of blood for a\nsimilar period, then a lump of flesh for a similar period. Then an angel is\nsent to blow the breath of life into the embryo. The angel is then\ncommanded to write four things: one’s destined provisions, lifespan,\nactions, and whether one will be happy or miserable ˹in the Hereafter˺.”\n[840] See footnote for 7:54.\n[841] Adam (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n842] Other possible translations: 1. “Do not be in doubt that Moses received\nit.” 2. “Do not be in doubt of your meeting with Moses.”\n[843] i.e., prophets.\n844] The passage says that as a person cannot have two hearts, similarly, a\nman cannot have two real mothers, nor can a child have two real fathers.\n845] This divorce (called\nẓihâr) was commonly practiced in Arabia before the\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). If a man declared his wife as unlawful for him as the\n\n-- 661 of 694 --\n\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\nẓahr (back) of his mother, his wife would be divorced. Islam abolished\nthis type of divorce (see 58:3-4).\n846] The following distinction should be made:\n1. Sponsorship (which is permissible): a person can sponsor a child\nor host them in their home and care for them as they care for\ntheir own children, except for legal matters. For example,\nadopted children keep their last names, are allowed to marry the\nchildren of their adopted parent, adopted and biological children\nof the opposite sex should dress modestly in front of each other,\nand do not have a share in the estate of their adopted parents, but\ncan get a share of inheritance (up to one-third of the estate)\nthrough bequest (wa\nṣiyah).\n2. Adoption: a person is not allowed to take an orphan and give\nthem his/her last name, give them a share of inheritance similar\nto their own children, etc.\n847] This verse confirms a ruling mentioned in 8:75 which ended a previous\nruling that allowed inheritance between Muslims from Mecca (Al-\nMuhâjirûn, the Emigrants) and Muslims from Medina (Al-An\nṣâr, the\nHelpers). Now, only relatives can inherit from one another, whereas non-\nheirs can receive a share through bequest, up to one third of the estate.\nSee 4:7, 11-13, 32-33, and 176.\n848] See footnote for 27:75.\n849] In 5 A.H./627 C.E., the Meccan pagans along with some Arab and\nJewish tribes (totalling around 10 000 soldiers) laid a siege around\nMedina, where the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was positioned with 3000 soldiers.\nThe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had anticipated the offence and, upon an advice\nfrom one of his companions, dug a trench around the city to protect it\nfrom invaders. After several unsuccessful attempts to cross the trench, the\nallied enemies quickly lost morale, and were forced to end the siege due\nto severe weather conditions. This encounter is commonly known as the\nBattle of the Trench or the Enemy Alliance.\n[850] The angels.\n[851] lit., from above and below you.\n852] The believers were reassured while the doubts of the hypocrites grew\nmore fierce.\n\n-- 662 of 694 --\n\n853] Yathrib was the name of Medina before the arrival of the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and Muslim emigrants.\n[854] Until the end of your short life on earth.\n[855] See footnote for 7:46.\n856] The Jews of Banu Quraiẓah who had violated their treaty with the\nMuslims and sided with the enemy alliance. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) asked\nhow they wished to be judged, and they chose to be judged by their book,\nthe Torah—in which the penalty for treason is death.\n857] Allah’s revelations refers to verses of the Quran whereas prophetic\nwisdom refers to the sayings and teachings of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص),\nknown collectively as\nḥadîth.\n858] Though Islam and Îmân are sometimes used interchangeably in the\nQuran, Îmân is a higher state of Islam. A Muslim is someone who\nobserves the five pillars of Islam, but a believer is someone with strong\nfaith, who does everything purely for the sake of Allah, and is mindful of\nAllah in everything they say or do. Every Mu'min (believer/faithful) is a\nMuslim, but not every Muslim is a Mu'min. See 49:14.\n859] Meaning, if Allah makes a ruling in the Quran or the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nmakes a ruling, then a Muslim is not allowed to seek judgment from\nanyone else, nor follow their own desires.\n860] This refers to Zaid ibn Ḥârithah, the Prophet’s adopted son before\nadoption was made unlawful. His wife, Zainab bint Jaḥsh was from a\nprestigious family. Because Zaid and Zainab came from two different\nsocial classes, the marriage was not successful. Eventually, Zaid insisted\non divorcing his wife, despite several appeals from the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\nSince one’s adopted son was no longer considered to be one’s own son,\nthe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was later allowed to marry Zainab.\n861] Allah’s favour to Zaid was to guide him to Islam, and the Prophet’s\nfavour was to free him from slavery.\n862] He (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is not the father of Zaid (mentioned in 33:37) or any other\nman. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had three biological sons, who all died in\nchildhood.\n[863] Before the marriage is consummated.\n864] If divorce is pronounced after the consummation of marriage, a waiting\nperiod of three months is observed to give the couple a chance to get\n\n-- 663 of 694 --\n\nback together and to see if the wife is pregnant (see 65:4). But if the\ndivorce happens before the marriage is consummated, then there is no\nwaiting period.\n[865] See footnote for 4:3.\n866] This ruling was exclusively for the Prophet (which he never took\nadvantage of), but Muslims have to pay a dowry to their wives. Some\nwomen did offer themselves to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in marriage, but he\ndeclined.\n867] The Prophet’s married life can be classified as follows:\nUntil the age of 25: he was single.\nAge 25 – 50: he was married only to Khadîjah.\nAge 50 – 52: he was single after Khadîjah’s death.\nAge 53 – his death at the age of 63: he had a total of ten wives.\nMany of these marriages were to widows (who had been left\nwith their children without a provider) and in some cases to\nfoster stronger ties with some of his companions and\nneighbouring tribes. Of all the women he married, ’Ȃishah was\nthe only virgin.\n868] Paternal and maternal uncles are similar to the fathers.\n869] By attributing children to Him or associating gods with Him in worship.\n870] By calling him a liar or speaking ill of him and his family.\n[871] By harming them physically or accusing them falsely.\n872] He has forgiven what Muslim women did in the past because they were\nnot obligated to cover up.\n873] This verse is intended to deter the hypocrites. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nnever killed any hypocrite as long as they did not join the enemy to attack\nand kill Muslims.\n874] The Quran does not specify how Moses was slandered by some of his\npeople. Some narrations suggest that he was either falsely accused of\nadultery (see footnote for 28:76), killing his brother Aaron (who died a\nnatural death), or having a skin disease since he, unlike others, used to\nbathe with his clothes on.\n875] This refers to free choice in shouldering religious commandments. The\ngreat majority of Allah’s creation (like angels and animals) do not have\nfree will. Therefore, they are inherently submissive to Allah. As for\n\n-- 664 of 694 --\n\nhumans, they rely on their intelligence, and are free to choose between\nguidance and misguidance, and either to adhere to divine obligations and\nprohibitions or not.\n876] This is a guarantee from Allah that if the hypocrites and polytheists ever\nturn to Him in repentance, He is always willing to forgive them.\n877] See footnote for 33:6.\n[878] Which was permissible at the time of Solomon (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[879] Which he died while leaning on.\n[880] lit., tamarisks.\n[881] lit., lote trees.\n[882] i.e., Mecca and Jerusalem.\n883] They became bored of living comfortably and traveling easily. A similar\nexample can be found in 2:61, where the Children of Israel became bored\nwith the manna and quails and wanted to eat other things such as onions\nand garlic.\n884] Iblîs was the name of Satan before his fall from grace (see footnote for\n2:34). His assumption (or vow) was that he could easily mislead the\nmajority of people (see 7:16-17, 15:39-40, and 38:82-83).\n[885] The believers and polytheists.\n[886] i.e., the devils.\n[887] Like the people of Pharaoh, ’Ȃd, and Thamûd.\n[888] i.e., Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[889] From the place of Judgment to Hell.\n[890] When it is already too late.\n[891] Satan.\n[892] Created your father, Adam, from dust.\n[893] Males and females.\n894] See footnote for 33:6.\n895] This can also mean that they are in awe of their Lord as much in private\nas they are in public.\n[896] This implies Hell and Paradise.\n897] According to a Prophetic narration collected by Ibn Ḥibbân, the total\nnumber of prophets sent around the world, from Adam (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n\n-- 665 of 694 --\n\nMuḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), is 124 000—of which only twenty-five are\nmentioned in the Quran.\n[898] i.e., the Torah, the Gospel, and Psalms.\n[899] See previous footnote.\n[900] The Reminder is another name for the Quran.\n901] See footnote for 35:18.\n902] See footnote for 35:11.\n903] The moon completes a cycle every month (waxing and waning), while\nthe sun takes a whole year to complete its cycle (resulting in the spring,\nsummer, fall, and winter seasons).\n904] On the Day of Judgment, the Trumpet will be blown by an angel—\ncausing all to die. When it is blown a second time, everyone will be\nraised from the dead for judgment (see 39:68).\n905] Meaning, We have the ability to turn them into stone or any other\ninanimate object.\n906] Human beings are born weak, then they reach their prime, then they\ngrow weak after a certain age. See 30:54.\n[907] lit., ‘what Our Own Hands have created.’\n908] Another meaning is that those idols will be assembled to witness the\ntorment of their worshippers on Judgment Day.\n909] The verse refers to two types of Arabian trees, markh and ’afâr, which\nproduce fire when their green branches are rubbed together.\n910] i.e., the angels, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the mountains.\n[911] Their father Adam (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n912] This is when the Trumpet will be blown the second time.\n913] Other possible translations: 1. “It was you who used to pressure us.” 2.\n“It was you who tricked us in the name of the truth.” 3. “It was you who\ndissuaded us from doing good.” 4. “It was you who deceived us with\nfalse oaths.”\n914] This implies all sorts of delicacies, not just fruits.\n915] Facing each other implies that no one will have anything in their hearts\nagainst others.\n916] ‘Bai\nḍun maknûn’ can also mean spotless eggs.\n\n-- 666 of 694 --\n\n917] It is assumed that they will ask each other about their lives in the world\nand what led them to Paradise.\n918] The pagans of Mecca used to make fun of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) when he\nwarned them of this tree. They asked, “How can a tree grow in Hell?” So\nAllah revealed this verse in response.\n[919] i.e., the believers in his family.\n[920] Noah’s sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n921] His people reportedly made decisions based on constellations, so\nAbraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) pretended to do the same to convince them he was not\nable to join them at their pagan feast.\n922] See footnote for 26:82.\n923] Allah sent a ram to be sacrificed in place of Ishmael.\n924] The birth of Isaac is announced after the story of sacrifice. So this is a\nproof that the son who was going to be sacrificed was Ishmael, not Isaac.\nThis is also supported by 11:71, where Sarah is told that she would give\nbirth to Isaac, who would (reach adulthood and) have a son by the name\nof Jacob.\n[925] Abraham or Ishmael.\n[926] Lot’s wife.\n[927] For abandoning his city without Allah’s permission.\n928] Before being swallowed and while inside the whale (see 21:87). The\nlesson is: good deeds are of great help during difficult times.\n[929] The belly of the whale would have become his grave.\n930] The squash plant provided Jonah with shade and repelled harmful\ninsects.\n931] Some pagan Arabs believed that the angels were Allah’s daughters.\nSome of them were ashamed to have daughters and took pride in their\nown sons.\n932] Both sexes are equal before Allah, so the verse questions pagan\nchauvinism.\n933] Or “Yet the jinn know well that they themselves will be brought ˹for\njudgment˺.” This is based on the claim of some pagan Arabs that the\nangels are Allah’s daughters through female jinn.\n\n-- 667 of 694 --\n\n934] The “Reminder” mentioned here refers to Scriptures such as the Torah\nand the Gospel. It is commonly used in the Quran as another name for\nIslam’s holy book.\n[935] lit., when it lands in their courtyards.\n936] The pagans demanded an angel to deliver the message, not a human\nbeing like themselves.\n937] They meant that the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is not concerned with their\nguidance, and that he only wants to gain dominance over them.\n938] This refers either to the concept of the Trinity in Christianity or Arab\npolytheistic beliefs.\n939] In other words, they do not question the honesty of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص),\nbut question the Quran itself. This verse is similar to 6:33.\n940] This verse alludes to the defeat of the Meccan pagans later at Badr.\n[941] i.e., pyramids and obelisks.\n[942] i.e., the people of Shu’aib (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[943] Brother in faith or business partner.\n944] The verses do not offer a reason why David (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) asked for Allah’s\nforgiveness. He either did so because he did not make himself available\nto judge between people or because he entertained some evil thoughts\nabout the two men, thinking they actually came to assassinate him. Still\nhe listened to both of them and made a fair judgment.\n945] Some commentators have a different interpretation, which is not\nsupported by reliable sources. They maintain that Solomon kept watching\nthese fine horses until the sun set, then he realized that he had missed the\nnoon prayer because of his love for horses, so he killed them, striking at\ntheir legs and necks.\n946] It is reported in a\nḥadîth collected by Bukhâri that one night Solomon\nsaid that each of his wives would conceive a boy who would struggle in\nAllah’s cause. He forgot to say ‘Allah willing,” so only one of them gave\nbirth to a deformed, dead baby. So Solomon prayed to Allah for\nforgiveness.\n[947] The jinn dived to bring him pearls.\n948] Job was afflicted with losing his children, community, and with a long\nillness. Only his wife stayed with him. He once became angry with his\n\n-- 668 of 694 --\n\nwife and vowed to give her one hundred lashes if he recovered. When\nJob’s affliction was lifted, he became remorseful at what he had said. To\nhelp Job fulfil his vow without harming his wife, Allah ordered him to\nstrike her with a bundle of one hundred blades of grass.\n949] Scholars are in disagreement as to whether Ⱬul-Kifl was a prophet or\njust a righteous man. Those who maintain that he was a prophet identify\nhim with various Biblical prophets such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Obadiah.\n950] Meaning, they are not welcome since their presence in Hell with us will\nnot benefit us in anyway.\n951] In other words, did we underestimate them?\n952] When the angels obeyed Allah’s orders to prostrate before Adam,\nwhereas Satan refused to comply.\n[953] See footnote for 2:34.\n954] The command to bow down was a test of obedience. Satan arrogantly\nrefused to comply because he believed he was superior to Adam\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n955] Those who are devoted to Allah alone and those who associate other\ngods with Him.\n[956] i.e., Adam (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[957] i.e., Eve.\n958] The four pairs (males and females), as listed in 6:143-144, are: a pair of\nsheep, a pair of goats, a pair of camels, and a pair of oxen.\n959] The three layers of darkness are: the belly, the womb, and the amniotic\nsac.\n960] This verse can apply to anything that a person listens to, and it can also\napply specifically to the Quran—meaning, for example, those who read\nverses about retaliation and other verses about forgiveness, then they opt\nfor forgiveness.\n961] The slave owned by several quarrelsome masters will always be\nconfused because their masters will always give them conflicting orders\n—similarly, one who worships multiple gods will never find peace\nbetween them. This parable is a logical argument against the existence of\nmultiple gods, since each god would try to covet what it created. See\n23:91 for a similar argument.\n\n-- 669 of 694 --\n\n[962] Like Korah (see 28:76-81).\n963] No matter how big someone’s sins are, they cannot be bigger than\nAllah’s mercy. Based on 4:48, the only unforgivable sin in Islam is if\nsomeone dies while disbelieving in Allah or associating others with Him\nin worship. In an authentic narration collected by At-Tirmiⱬi, the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) reports that Almighty Allah says, \"O children of Adam! As long\nas you call upon Me, putting your hope in Me, I will forgive you for what\nyou have done, and I will not mind. O children of Adam! If your sins\nwere to reach the clouds of the sky and then you sought My forgiveness, I\nwould ˹still˺ forgive you. O children of Adam! If you were to come to Me\nwith sins filling the whole world and then you came to Me without\nassociating other gods with Me, I would certainly match your sins with\nforgiveness.\"\n964] This refers to the place where the judgment will be held. The Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reported in a\nḥadîth collected by Aṭ-Ṭabarâni to have said,\n“The Judgment will be passed on an earth where neither blood has been\nshed nor any sin committed.”\n965] This is emphasized in 21:105. The meaning is that Allah will award\nParadise to the believers to be its residents forever. Some commentators\nsay that the word “inherit” is used because of the understanding that\nwhen Allah created Paradise and Hell, He made places for all of\nhumanity in both. Those who will go to Paradise will inherit the spots of\nthe disbelievers who chose misguidance (which leads to Hell), and those\nwho will go to Hell will inherit the spots of those who chose guidance\n(which leads to Paradise).\n966] The believers will praise Him for His grace, and the disbelievers will\npraise Him for His justice.\n967] You created us from nothing, then gave us life in the wombs of our\nmothers, then caused us to die at the end of our worldly lives, and finally\nresurrected us after our death (see 2:28).\n968] It is reported in a\nḥadîth collected by Imâm Muslim that everyone and\neverything that has ever existed will die on that Day, except for Allah—\nthe Eternal. He will then ask, “Who does all authority belong to this Day?\nWhere are the kings of the world? I am the King.” Since no one will be\n\n-- 670 of 694 --\n\nthere to answer, Allah will answer Himself, “˹All authority belongs˺ to\nAllah—the One, the Supreme!”\n[969] i.e., Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n970] Meaning, your ancestors, because Joseph (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) died over 400\nhundred years before Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[971] See 28:38.\n972] Another possible translation: “Without a doubt, whatever ˹gods˺ you are\ncalling me to ˹worship˺ have no claim ˹to divinity˺ in this world or the\nHereafter.”\n973] The verse does not say “Those in the Fire will cry out to its keepers,”\nsimply because there are levels in the Fire: those in higher levels will\nplead to the keepers of the depths of Hell to appeal to Allah to lighten the\npunishment even for one day, since they think they are better than those\nat the bottom.\n[974] i.e., the Hellfire.\n975] Like other prophets, Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was infallible of sin. The\nverse here refers to misjudgments, such as the Prophet’s response to the\nblind man (80:1-10), Jonah’s departure from his city without Allah’s\npermission (21:87-88), and David’s suspicions of the two men who\nscaled the wall of his sanctuary (38:21-25). If the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nhimself is urged to seek forgiveness, then the believers are even more in\nneed of praying for Allah’s forgiveness.\n[976] Your father, Adam.\n977] Nu\nṭfah refers to the union of male and female gametes (sperm and egg)\nwhich results in the zygote after fertilization.\n[978] ’Alaqah, meaning the embryo resembles a leech.\n[979] i.e., milk, wool, and hide.\n980] And ridiculed the divine knowledge brought to them by their\nmessengers.\n981] These four Days include the first two, so the total period of creation is\nsix heavenly Days.\n[982] See footnote for 7:54.\n[983] lit., a bitter and screaming wind.\n\n-- 671 of 694 --\n\n984] It is reported in Ibn Kathîr’s commentary that, on the Day of Judgment,\nthe wicked will deny the evil deeds in their records—as a desperate\nattempt to escape the horrible punishment in Hell. They will be asked if\nthey accept Allah, the angels, or even their own families and neighbours\nas witnesses, but they will refuse. So Allah will make their organs testify\nagainst them.\n985] i.e., associating others with Allah in worship and denying the Hereafter.\nSee 43:36-37.\n[986] Especially at the time of their death.\n[987] lit., Muslims.\n988] This refers to the noise the disbelievers used to make when the Quran\nwas recited (see 41:26), or those who twist the meaning of Quranic\npassages and take them out of context.\n989] The Reminder is one of the names of the Quran.\n990] So they neither hear nor understand the call.\n991] That He will delay their judgment until the Hereafter.\n992] “The Mother of Cities” is an honorary title given to the city of Mecca\nbecause of its great religious significance as the home of Allah’s first\nhouse of worship ever built on earth, and perhaps because of its central\nlocation as well.\n993] All prophets came with the same message: have faith in one God and do\ngood. But each faith-community had their own law.\n994] Like 33:7, this verse names the five greatest prophets of Islam: Noah,\nAbraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muḥammad.\n995] No community split into believers and disbelievers until they received\nthe knowledge given by their prophet.\n[996] That He will delay their judgment until the Hereafter.\n[997] i.e., the Jews and Christians.\n998] This could also be a call to all believers to love and respect the\nimmediate family of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n999] Other possible translations: 1. “You will have no refuge then, nor will\nyou have an advocate ˹against punishment˺.” 2. “You will have no refuge\nthen, nor ˹grounds˺ to protest ˹the torment˺.”\n[1000] They totally deny previous favours.\n\n-- 672 of 694 --\n\n1001] This refers to the Preserved Tablet, Al-Law\nḥ Al-Ma\nḥfû\nẓ, in which\nAllah has written the destiny of His entire creation.\n1002] For example, in the stories of the people of Noah, Lot, Shu’aib and\nother nations that were destroyed, found throughout the Quran.\n1003] For example, male and female, sweet and bitter, day and night, plains\nand mountains, heat and cold, light and darkness.\n1004] See footnote for 37:149.\n[1005] i.e., the birth of a baby girl.\n[1006] See 2:130-132.\n1007] This refers to Mecca and Ṭâif, two cities in Arabia, around 100 km\napart.\n1008] From a worldly perspective, many people are comforted when they hear\nof others who went through similar trials as them. But this will not be the\ncase on Judgment Day. Everyone will be desperate to save themselves\nfrom the punishment, regardless of others.\n[1009] i.e., the hand and the staff (see 20:17-22).\n1010] The torments were: famine, shortage of crops, floods, locusts, lice,\nfrogs, and blood (see 7:130-133).\n[1011] See 7:134.\n[1012] Branches of the Nile.\n1013] Moses used to have a speech impediment. But when he became a\nprophet he prayed to Allah to help him speak clearly, and his prayer was\nanswered (see 20:25-36).\n1014] When 21:98 was revealed, warning the polytheists that all false gods\nwill be in Hell, ’Abdullâh ibn Az-Ziba’ra, a poet who always attacked\nIslam, argued with the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) that if what the verse says is\ntrue, then Jesus will be in Hell as well! The polytheists, who were\npresent, laughed in agreement with this argument. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nreplied that the verse was talking exclusively about idols, adding that\nJesus himself did not ask anyone to worship him. Verse 21:101 was later\nrevealed in support of the Prophet’s argument. Eventually, ’Abdullâh\naccepted Islam.\n[1015] Or “We could have easily produced angels from you …”\n[1016] Fruit also implies delicacies.\n\n-- 673 of 694 --\n\n[1017] Angel Mâlik is the chief keeper of Hell.\n[1018] i.e., Jesus, Ezra, and the angels.\n1019] The revelation of the Quran started on the 27th night of Ramaḍân—the\n9th month of the Islamic calendar (see 97:1 and 2:185)\n1020] One of the major signs of the Day of Judgment, according to authentic\nnarrations from the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), is overwhelming smoke. Some\nscholars cite 44:10-11 in support of this apocalyptic sign. However, 44:15\nsupports the understanding of this passage as referring to a drought,\nsimply because once major apocalyptic signs arrive, no second chances\nwill be given.\n1021] This refers to the drought that affected the Meccan pagans so badly that\nthey came to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), begging him to pray to Allah to\nremove the affliction from them.\n[1022] Meaning, let my people go.\n[1023] i.e., Pharaoh and his soldiers.\n1024] Tubba’ Al-Ḥimiari was an ancient righteous Yemeni king whose people\npersisted in disbelief and were destroyed, although they were superior to\nMeccans in strength and manpower.\n1025] Zaqqûm is a tree that grows in the depths of Hell as mentioned in\n37:62-65. The pagans of Mecca used to make fun of the Prophet and say,\n“How can a tree grow in Hell?”\n1026] Abu Jahl, a Meccan pagan leader, met the warning of punishment in the\nHereafter by exclaiming, “How can I be punished when I am the mighty,\nnoble one!”\n[1027] i.e., rain.\n1028] By sending many prophets, and showing them unique miracles such as\nthe splitting of the sea.\n1029] No community split into believers and disbelievers until they received\nthe knowledge given by their prophet.\n[1030] Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n1031] This refers to ’Abdullâh ibn Salâm, a Jewish scholar, who embraced\nIslam when the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) emigrated to Medina.\n[1032] Poor and powerless Muslims.\n\n-- 674 of 694 --\n\n1033] The people of ’Ȃd were the residents of the hills in the southern part of\nthe Arabian Peninsula.\n[1034] The people of Hûd.\n[1035] Or never failed in creating them.\n1036] Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muḥammad are called the\nMessengers of Firm Resolve.\n[1037] i.e., only for a very short period of time.\n[1038] This passage discusses armed combat in the battlefield only.\n1039] Another possible interpretation: “And those who fight in the cause of\nAllah.”\n1040] Once in Paradise, the believers will recognize their mansions just like\nthey recognized their homes in the world.\n1041] Meaning, the disbelievers enjoy their life to the fullest while they are\nheedless of what will happen to them in the Hereafter, just like the cattle\nthat graze in the pasture are unaware that they will probably end up in the\nslaughter house.\n1042] The coming of Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is one of the signs of the Hour.\n1043] Like other prophets, Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was infallible of sin. The\nverse here refers to misjudgments, such as the example given in 80:1-10.\nIf the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) himself is urged to seek forgiveness, then the\nbelievers are even more in need of praying for Allah’s forgiveness.\n[1044] As you did before Islam.\n[1045] i.e., your opposition to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[1046] See footnote for 47:19.\n1047] i.e., that Allah will not support His Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and that\nmisfortune will befall the believers.\n1048] Another possible translation: “… so that you ˹all˺ may believe in Allah\nand His Messenger, support ˹His cause˺, revere, and glorify Him morning\nand evening.”\n[1049] See the introduction of this sûrah.\n1050] Those who pledged allegiance at Ḥudaibiyah were promised by Allah\nthat the spoils of war obtained from the Tribe of Khaibar would be\nexclusively theirs.\n[1051] Meaning, you only say so to deprive us of our share.\n\n-- 675 of 694 --\n\n1052] This refers to Hawâzin and Thaqîf, two pagan Arab tribes.\n[1053] The conquest of Khaibar in 7 A.H./628 C.E.\n[1054] Or the spoils of Khaibar.\n1055] lit., turn their backs.\n1056] A group of Meccans wanted to attack the Muslims on their way to\nMecca, but were taken captive by the Muslims, then were released.\n1057] The animals that Muslims had brought along to be sacrificed after\ncompleting the rituals of the minor pilgrimage (’umrah).\n1058] By doing so, the Meccan Muslims who were unknown to their fellow\nbelievers were safe, along with the pagans who later accepted Islam.\n1059] This is when the pagans prevented the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and the\nbelievers from entering the Sacred House for ’umrah and the arrogance\nthey showed when drafting the peace agreement.\n1060] The declaration of faith that there is only one God to be worshipped and\nthat Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is His Messenger.\n1061] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had a dream that he and his companions were\ngoing to enter the Sacred Mosque in peace.\n1062] Pilgrims are required to shave or trim their hair upon successfully\ncompleting the rituals of pilgrimage.\n1063] This refers to the Treaty of Ḥudaibiyah and/or the gains of Khaibar\nbefore the fulfilment of the Prophet’s vision to enter Mecca for ’umrah.\n1064] This passage and the next should be understood in their historical\ncontext. The Muslims were urged to be firm with the Arab pagans and\ntheir allies who were at war with Muslims at that time. Otherwise, Islam\nencourages the Muslims to treat peaceful non-Muslims with kindness and\nfairness. See 60:8-9.\n1065] Prostration means lying down on one’s face (i.e., touching the ground\nwith the forehead and nose while resting on knees and flat palms of both\nhands) as an act of prayer and submission to Allah.\n1066] In Deuteronomy 33:1-3, ˹Moses proclaimed:˺ “The Lord came from\nSinai. Rising from Seir upon us, he shone forth from Mount Paran,\naccompanied by a myriad of his holy ones, with flaming fire from his\nright hand for them. Indeed, lover of people, all of his holy ones are in\n\n-- 676 of 694 --\n\nyour control. They gather at your feet to do as you have instructed. [sic]”\nParan is a mountain in Mecca.\n1067] In Matthew 13:3-9, “˹Jesus˺ spoke many things to them in parables,\nsaying, “Behold, the sower went out to sow. … ˹A seed˺ fell on the good\nsoil and yielded a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.\n“He who has ears, let him hear.”’ Or the parable of the growing seed in\nMark 4:26-28.\n[1068] See the first footnote for 48:29.\n1069] There is also a different interpretation: “… nor call him ˹by his name˺ as\nyou call one another.” In other words, Do not say, ‘O Muḥammad.’\nRather, say, ‘O Prophet.’\n1070] A group from the tribe of Bani Tamîm came to see the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nwhile he was taking a nap in the afternoon. They stood outside the homes\nof his wives and started calling him out loud.\n1071] Al-Walîd ibn ’Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’aiṭ was sent by the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nto collect alms-tax from Bani Al-Muṣṭaliq. They went out to receive Al-\nWalîd but he assumed they wanted to harm him. Therefore, he quickly\nreturned to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) with the bad news so he would punish\nthem. Shortly after, a delegation from Bani Al-Muṣṭaliq came to clarify\nthe misunderstanding.\n[1072] Or things would have been difficult for you.\n1073] Backbiting people is likened to eating their dead bodies. So if eating\nsomeone’s flesh is detestable, then backbiting them is no different.\n1074] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reported in a\nḥadîth collected by Imâm Aḥmed\nto have said, \"O humanity! Your Lord is one, and your ancestry is one.\nNo Arab is superior to a non-Arab, nor is any non-Arab superior to any\nArab. No white is superior to any black, nor is any black superior to any\nwhite except on account of their righteousness.\"\n1075] The verse makes a distinction between Islam (the declaration of\naccepting the faith, then performing Islamic duties such as prayers and\nfasting) and Îmân (a higher state of Islam, which means to embrace the\nfaith wholeheartedly). This distinction is very clear in a famous narration\nfrom the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), commonly known as the\nḤadîth of Gabriel.\n[1076] Or a Record preserving ˹everything˺.\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n\n-- 677 of 694 --\n\n1077] Meaning, they are confused about the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص): some say he is\na poet, some say he is a fabricator, while others say he is insane. They\nalso rejected the Quran as poetry, magic, or ancient fables.\n1078] Ar-Rass means “well” or “water-pit”. This refers to a pagan people,\nalong with Midian, to whom Allah sent Prophet Shu’aib (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[1079] The people of Shu’aib (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n1080] Tubba’ Al-Ḥimiari was an ancient righteous Yemeni king whose people\npersisted in disbelief and were destroyed, although they were superior to\nthe Meccans in strength and manpower.\n1081] The angel to the right records the good deeds of each person, while the\none to the left records every evil deed. They always accompany the\nperson at all times, except when one uses the toilet or is intimate with\ntheir spouse.\n1082] When a denier dies, they will realize that resurrection, judgment,\nParadise, and Hell are all true.\n1083] This is the second blow which will cause all to come back to life for\njudgment.\n1084] Meaning, the decree to punish wicked humans and jinn (see 11:119 and\n32:13).\n1085] This can also mean that they are in awe of their Lord as much in private\nas they are in public.\n1086] i.e., looking at the Face of the Almighty (see 10:26 and 75:22-23).\n[1087] See footnote for 7:54.\n1088] Some scholars believe this verse comes in response to Exodus 31:17,\nwhich says, “The Lord made the heavens and the earth in six days, but on\nthe seventh day He rested and was refreshed.”\n[1089] This verse refers to the times of the five daily prayers.\n[1090] See footnote for 50:20.\n[1091] Or “By the heavens with their marvellous orbits.”\n1092] See footnote for 50:5.\n1093] Other possible translations: 1. “… by which the deluded are turned\naway.” 2. “Whoever is turned away from it is ˹truly˺ deluded.”\n1094] Optional prayers before dawn are recommended, and are more likely to\nbe accepted.\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n\n-- 678 of 694 --\n\n1095] Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) did not want his guests to know that he was going to\nprepare a meal for them so they would not ask him not to.\n1096] As mentioned in 11:69-70, the angels came to Abraham in the form of\nmen and when he offered them food, they did not eat. In ancient Middle\nEastern culture, if a guest refused to eat the food provided by their host, it\nwas a sign of ill-will.\n[1097] Prophet Isaac (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[1098] Lot (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his two daughters.\n[1099] The ruins of Sodom.\n[1100] Because of his arrogance and disbelief.\n1101] lit., ‘a barren wind,’ since the wind was not productive—it did not carry\nrain or fertilize trees.\n1102] Meaning, you have only three days to live. See 11:65.\n1103] The globe was spread out to accommodate Allah’s creation. The\nspherical shape of the earth is expressed in 39:5.\n1104] For example, male and female, sweet and bitter, day and night, plains\nand mountains, heat and cold, light and darkness.\n1105] Since you have already delivered the message clearly.\n1106] Where Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) communicated with Allah.\n[1107] i.e., the Quran.\n1108] This is either the Sacred House in Mecca, which is frequented by\npilgrims, or a sanctuary in Heaven, which is frequented by angels.\n1109] The seas and oceans will be on fire on Judgment Day.\n1110] One gets the reward for being patient in difficult times in this world. As\nfor the Hereafter, those who suffer patiently in Hell will not be rewarded\nfor their patience.\n1111] Meaning, no one will carry the burden of another’s sins.\n1112] It is assumed that they will ask each other about their lives in the world\nand what led them to Paradise.\n1113] The pagan leaders claimed to be Mecca’s most intelligent minds. So this\nverse questions their intelligence, arguing that the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\ncannot be a madman and a poet at the same time.\n1114] Arab pagans were challenged in the Quran to produce its equivalent\n(52:34), or ten sûrahs (11:13), or at least one sûrah (2:23), but the\n\n-- 679 of 694 --\n\nchallenge has never been met.\n1115] See footnote for 37:149.\n1116] i.e., famine, droughts, or the defeat at the Battle of Badr (see 32:21).\nThe Battle of Badr took place in the 15th year of the Prophet’s mission.\nThe previous passage poses fifteen questions to the Meccan pagans\nbefore warning them in this passage.\n[1117] Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n[1118] The angel Gabriel.\n1119] Gabriel used to come to the Prophet in a human form. But he appeared\nto him (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) twice in his angelic form: once at the beginning of the\nProphet’s mission (when the angel manifested himself, filling the\nhorizon, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) lost his consciousness), and another time\nduring the Prophet’s Night Journey to the seventh heaven to receive the\norder to pray directly from Allah (see 17:1).\n[1120] lit., he was only two bow-draws away.\n1121] The Prophet was taken to heaven to see some of Allah’s magnificent\nsigns. He only saw what he was told to see.\n[1122] See footnote for 52:39.\n1123] Meaning, “You call them gods while in fact they are not gods.”\n1124] Arab pagans took these idols as intermediaries to intercede for them on\nthe Day of Judgment (see 39:3)\n[1125] i.e., the Quran.\n[1126] i.e., Paradise.\n[1127] i.e., your father, Adam.\n[1128] See footnote for 31:34.\n1129] This passage refers to Al-Walîd ibn Al-Mughîrah who initially accepted\nIslam, and then a man persuaded him to leave Islam, promising to be\npunished in his place in the Hereafter for a small fee in this world.\nInitially, Al-Walîd paid him some of the amount they had agreed upon\nthen refused to pay the rest.\n[1130] lit., laughter and weeping.\n[1131] A star worshipped by some ancient pagans.\n[1132] Also known as the second ’Ȃd.\n1133] The stones of baked clay that were rained upon them (see 11:82-83).\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n\n-- 680 of 694 --\n\n1134] The Meccan pagans challenged the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to have the moon\nsplit in two if he wanted them to believe in him. The moon was split, and\nthen re-joined, as reported by several eyewitnesses, but still the pagans\nrefused to believe, calling this miracle “sheer magic.”\n1135] A miracle (usually referred to as a ‘sign’ in the Quran) can be defined\nas an extraordinary event manifesting divine intervention in human\naffairs. Every prophet was given miracles to prove he was commissioned\nby Allah. Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was given the miracle of the staff and many\nothers. Jesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) gave life to the dead and healed the blind and the\nleper. And Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received the Quran, a literary miracle,\nto challenge the masters of Arabic eloquence. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nperformed some other miracles such as splitting the moon, multiplying\nfood and water, and healing some of his companions.\n1136] Angel Isrâfîl will blow the Trumpet, causing all to be raised from the\ndead for judgment.\n[1137] i.e., the Judgment.\n[1138] The Flood or the Ark.\n[1139] lit., a bitter and screaming wind.\n[1140] Who came in the form of handsome men.\n[1141] This was later fulfilled in the Battle of Badr.\n[1142] Saqar is one of the names of Hell.\n[1143] To bring anything into being.\n[1144] “Be!” And it is!\n[1145] Rivers of water, milk, honey, and wine. See 47:15.\n[1146] lit., prostrate.\n1147] This question is repeated thirty-one times in this sûrah: eight times after\nreminders of Allah’s favours, seven times in the passage talking about the\npunishment of the deniers of judgment (which is the number of the gates\nof Hell), and eight times in each of the two following passages talking\nabout Paradise, which has eight gates.\n1148] The two points of sunrise and sunset in the summer and the winter.\n1149] See footnote for 25:53.\n[1150] lit., your Lord’s Face.\n\n-- 681 of 694 --\n\n1151] Death is listed as one of Allah’s favours since it puts an end to tyrants,\nends the suffering of the oppressed, makes all people equal, ushers in\njudgment and the enforcement of justice, and leads the believers to\neternal joy and peace in Paradise.\n1152] Giving life and causing death, making some rich and others poor,\nelevating some and debasing others, etc.\n1153] According to the next three passages (as well as the next sûrah), people\nwill be divided into three groups on Judgment Day:\n1. The foremost: the righteous who are always ahead of others in\nfaith and goodness.\n2. The people of the right: the average believers who will receive\ntheir records of deeds with their right hands.\n3. The people of the left: the disbelievers who will receive their\nrecords with their left hands.\n1154] Since their sins are already known to Allah and written in perfect\nrecords, they will only be interrogated as a form of punishment.\n1155] Warning of the punishment in Hell is listed as a favour just like the\npromise of the reward in Paradise. Think of this as a road sign: the latter\nis like a sign about food, gas, etc., and the former is like a cautionary sign\nabout an accident ahead or something hazardous. Both signs benefit\npeople.\n[1156] Before these righteous servants in Paradise.\n1157] See footnote for verses 31-45 in the previous sûrah.\n1158] Unlike this world of sheer injustice, the Hereafter will put everyone in\ntheir right place. The righteous will be elevated in Paradise, while the\nwicked will be humiliated in Hell.\n1159] Another possible translation: “only exchanging greetings of peace.”\n1160] i.e., associating others with Allah in worship and denying the\nresurrection and judgment.\n1161] See footnote for 44:43.\n1162] This verse refers to two types of Arabian trees, markh and ’afâr, which\nproduce fire when their green branches are rubbed together.\n[1163] See 43:4.\n\n-- 682 of 694 --\n\n1164] This verse refutes the pagan claim that the Quran was sent down by\ndevils (see 26:210-212). Based on this verse, many jurists maintain that a\nMuslim should perform ablutions before reading the Quran.\n1165] Some pagans believed that rain was caused by some stars.\n1166] lit., fragrant basil. Throughout the Quran, Paradise is described as being\npleasant to the eye, the heart, and the ear. This verse emphasizes the scent\nas well.\n1167] Another possible translation: “the Manifest ˹through His signs˺ and the\nHidden ˹from His creation˺.”\n[1168] See footnote for 7:54.\n[1169] By His knowledge.\n[1170] See 7:172.\n1171] Prior to the victory over Mecca, Muslims were outnumbered and\nperceived as weak. Once Mecca surrendered to the Muslims, many tribes\neither accepted Islam or made peace agreements with the Muslim victors.\nTherefore, the believers who donated and strived at the time of hardship\nand weakness deserve more rewards than those who did so at the time of\nease and prominence.\n[1172] i.e., Paradise.\n1173] This wall is said to be the barrier of Al-A’râf (or the heights) between\nParadise and Hell. See 7:46-49.\n[1174] Satan.\n[1175] So it is easy for Him to soften your hearts as well.\n[1176] i.e., Paradise.\n[1177] By His knowledge.\n1178] Some Jews used to play with words when they addressed the Prophet\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to ridicule him, saying for example ‘Asâmu ’alaikum’ (death be\nupon you) instead of ‘Asalâmu ’alaikum’ (peace be upon you)—which is\nthe greeting of Islam, inspired by Allah.\n1179] Some companions used to ask the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) unnecessary and\nsometimes meaningless questions. For example: who their fathers were,\nwhere their lost animals were, and what they had in their pockets. Some\nwould ask for new rulings that would probably make things difficult for\nsome Muslims or even themselves. So this verse was revealed to cut\n\n-- 683 of 694 --\n\ndown such practice. Eventually, the ruling was lifted in order not to make\nit difficult for people with good questions, who could not afford to give a\ncharity.\n[1180] Spirit here can mean revelation, light, or help.\n1181] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) allowed Banu An-Naḍîr to carry whatever they\ncould on their camels, so they removed the wooden pillars of their\nhomes, causing them to collapse.\n11 8 2 ] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had instructed the Muslim army not to cut down\ntrees, but some soldiers had to remove some palm trees to be able to enter\nthe fort, to the dismay of Banu An-Naḍîr. When Muslims disagreed on\nthat act, this verse was revealed.\n1183] The verses here talk about the distribution of gains acquired without\nfighting. These gains are mostly distributed among the poor and the\nneedy. As for the spoils of war, four-fifths of the spoils are distributed\namong the fighters. See 8:41.\n[1184] Commonly known as Al-An\nṣâr (or the Helpers).\n[1185] Meaning, Banu An-Naḍîr.\n1186] This either refers to the defeat of the Meccan pagans at the Battle of\nBadr or the exile of Banu Qainuqâ’.\n[1187] See 14:22.\n[1188] i.e., the Hereafter.\n1189] Meaning, that the hearts of the disbelievers are harder than the\nmountains concerning the Quran.\n1190] Jabbâr comes from the root word ja-ba-ra which means to impose,\nsupport, or console. For example, Jabîrah means the cast that supports a\nbroken bone. Hence, Allah is the One Whose Will cannot be resisted, and\nWho comforts those who are broken or oppressed.\n[1191] lit., come out ˹of Mecca˺.\n1192] According to the Treaty of Ḥudaibiyah (see footnote for 48:1-3),\nMuslims who chose to move to Mecca would not be returned to Muslims\nin Medina, and Meccan pagans who accepted Islam and chose to move to\nMedina would be returned to Mecca (except for women).\n1193] Those who moved to Mecca to marry pagans.\n\n-- 684 of 694 --\n\n1194] lit., nor come up with a falsehood they have forged between their own\nhands and legs.\n1195] Some companions desperately asked the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) about the\nbest deeds. When he told them that one of the best deeds is to fight in\nself-defence, they pledged to do so. But when the order came to fight the\nMeccan pagans, some either did not comply or fled in battles like Uḥud.\n1196] Aḥmad is another name for Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Both are\nderived from\nḥa-ma-da which means ‘praise.’ Some Muslim scholars\nbelieve this verse refers to John 14:16, where Jesus says: “And I will ask\nthe Father, and he will give you another periklytos, to be with you\nforever.” Periklytos is a Greek word that means ‘the praised one.’ The\nname of Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) appears several times in the\nGospel of Barnabas, which is deemed apocryphal by Christian\nauthorities.\n1197] Submission to Allah means ‘Islam’ in Arabic.\n1198] Some Jews used to boast that they were Allah’s most beloved and that\nthey had been favoured with the Torah and the Sabbath, so the three\nfollowing passages came in response:\n1. What is the benefit of the Torah if it is not followed properly\n(62:5)?\n2. If you are truly Allah’s favourite servants then you should wish\nto meet Him (62:-6-8).\n3. Muslims have been blessed with Friday, equivalent to the\nSabbath (62:9-10).\n1199] Meaning, they can carry the physical burden of the books, but not\nunderstand a word of them.\n1200] i.e., disobeying Allah, killing some of the prophets (including Zachariah\nand John the Baptist), claiming to have killed Jesus, accusing Mary of\nadultery, and dealing with usury. See 4:153-158.\n1201] Initially, the Friday congregational prayer was performed first, followed\nby the sermon. On one occasion, a caravan of food arrived in Medina\nduring a time of hardship while the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was on the pulpit.\nFollowing ancient traditions, the caravan was received with drum-beats.\nMost congregants rushed to receive the caravan, leaving the Prophet\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n\n-- 685 of 694 --\n\n(ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the middle of the sermon. Henceforth, the sermon was given\nfirst so everyone would stay for the prayer.\n1202] This passage and the next refer to ’Abdullâh ibn Ubai, the chief\nhypocrite in Medina.\n[1203] i.e., the Quran.\n1204] This verse was revealed when some early Muslims were prevented from\nemigrating to Medina by their own spouses and children, so they could\nnot join the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and the rest of the believers to practice their\nfaith freely.\n1205] Meaning, when a husband intends to divorce his wife—after the\nconsummation of marriage—he should divorce her outside her monthly\ncycle, provided that he has not touched her after her period. This makes it\neasy for the wife to observe her ’iddah (waiting period for around three\nmonths, see 65:4). Otherwise, things will be complicated for her. For\nexample, if divorce happens after sexual intercourse, she might get\npregnant, which delays the end of ’iddah until the end of her pregnancy.\nIf divorce happens during a monthly cycle, scholars are in disagreement\nas to whether the divorce counts or not. If it does not, she has to wait\nuntil her menstruation is over to see if her husband still wants to divorce\nher.\n1206] Perhaps the husband who has divorced his wife may change his mind\nand restore the marriage before the end of her waiting period (after the\nfirst or second count of revocable divorce).\n1207] A husband may separate from his wife after each of the first two counts\nof divorce or at the end of her waiting period with dignity. If he chooses\nto stay with her after the first two counts of divorce then divorces her a\nthird time, the marriage is terminated at the end of her third waiting\nperiod. The wife will have to marry and divorce another man before she\ncan be remarried to her ex-husband (see 2:230). However, a woman\nmarrying someone with the intention of getting divorced, in order to\nreturn to her first husband, is forbidden.\n1208] This applies to pregnant women who are divorced or widowed.\n[1209] After the divorce is finalized.\n[1210] This is one of the names of the Quran.\n[1211] See 5:89.\n\n-- 686 of 694 --\n\n1212] Both wives were disbelievers. Noah’s wife used to give away the\nidentity of the new believers so the disbelievers could persecute them.\nAnd Lot’s wife used to tell the men about her husband’s handsome male\nvisitors so they could approach them.\n1213] Gabriel breathed into the sleeves of Mary’s garment so she conceived\nJesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n1214] Some may point to birth defects, genetic mutations, etc. and say these\nare flaws. This verse means that, in the grand scheme of creation,\neverything created has its place, form, and purpose, and that it does\nexactly what Allah ordained for it.\n[1215] See 72:8-10.\n1216] This can also mean that they are in awe of their Lord as much in private\nas they are in public.\n1217] Another possible translation: “This is what you were calling for.”\n1218] Meaning, whether Allah takes our lives (as you wish) or grants us a\nlong life, it is all good for us. But who will protect you from Allah if you\ndisbelieve in Him.\n1219] Like 53:33-35 and 74:11-26, these verses refer to Al-Walîd ibn Al-\nMughîrah, a leader of the Meccan opposition against Islam. He rejected\nthe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) as a madman, so the Quran responded by listing ten\nof his qualities—two of which were unknown to him: the fact that he was\nborn out of wedlock and that his nose would be chopped off several years\nlater at the Battle of Badr. At least three of his ten sons accepted Islam—\nincluding Khâlid ibn Al-Walîd.\n1220] This is the story of a righteous man who owned a garden and used to\ngive a share of the harvest to the poor. Following his death, his children\ndecided to keep all the produce for themselves and give nothing to the\npoor.\n1221] Another possible translation: “… without leaving some for the poor.”\n1222] It is believed that Allah accepted their repentance and replaced their\ngarden with a better one.\n[1223] i.e., if only the Meccan pagans knew.\n1224] Like the Face and the Hands, the Shin is believed by many to be one of\nthe qualities of Allah, in a way befitting His Majesty and Greatness.\n\n-- 687 of 694 --\n\nSince baring the shin in the Arab culture is associated with the heat of\nbattle, some interpret the verse metaphorically, so the meaning would be:\n“˹Beware of˺ the Day when horror sets in.”\n[1225] While inside the whale. See 21:87 and 37:139-148.\n[1226] This is one of the names of the Quran.\n[1227] The Striking Disaster is another name for the Day of Judgment.\n[1228] i.e., your ancestors.\n1229] According to 8:32, An-Naḍr ibn Al-Ḥârith challenged Allah, saying, “If\nthis is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones upon us from the\nsky or overcome us with a painful punishment.”\n[1230] The holy spirit is the angel Gabriel.\n1231] Judgment Day will seem like 50 000 years for a disbeliever, but it will\nseem like a very short period for a believer. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is\nreported in a\nḥadîth collected by Imâm Aḥmed to have said that, for the\nbeliever, this long period will be like the time they took to perform a\nsingle prayer in the world.\n1232] lit., private parts.\n[1233] See footnote for 4:3.\n1234] Some Meccan pagans used to gather around the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to\nmock him and the believers, saying that if there is in fact a Hereafter,\nthey are better entitled to Paradise than the poor believers.\n[1235] i.e., from a humble fluid. See 32:8.\n1236] The daily points of sunrise and sunset, caused by the earth’s rotation\naround its own axis.\n[1237] Or “… as if rushing towards a target.”\n1238] Meaning, it is out of Allah’s mercy that He does not hasten your\npunishment but allows you more time to repent.\n[1239] See 22:5 and 23:12-14.\n1240] i.e., your father Adam, who was created from clay.\n1241] These are the names of their main idols. Initially, these idols had been\nerected to commemorate some righteous people before the time of Noah.\nAfter many generations, however, the idols were taken as objects of\nworship.\nملسو هيلع هللا ىلص\n\n-- 688 of 694 --\n\n1242] Noah (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) prayed for his people’s destruction after Allah revealed\nto him that no one else was going to believe. See 11:36.\n1243] Meaning, evil jinn tempted some pagan Arabs to believe that the angels\nare Allah’s daughters through female jinn.\n[1244] See footnote for 6:128.\n1245] Some jinn used to eavesdrop on the heaven, then pass on what they\nheard to fortune-tellers. But this practice came to an end once\nMuḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was sent as a messenger with the Quran.\n1246] Meaning, to see if they will be grateful to Allah for rain and other\nprovisions.\n[1247] i.e., Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n1248] This passage lightens the ruling mentioned in 73:2-4. So from now on,\nthe believers do not have to stick to any of the portions specified at the\nbeginning of this sûrah. Rather, they can pray whatever they can at night.\n[1249] i.e., giving for charity and good causes.\n1250] The reward for your charity will be far better than what you left behind\nor what you have given in charity because it will be rewarded ten-fold, or\neven 700-fold, and Allah gives more to whoever He wills. See 2:261.\n1251] It was a common practice to give someone a gift, hoping to receive a\nmore valuable gift in return. This practice is disliked in Islam.\n1252] This is when the Trumpet will be blown for the second time, causing\neveryone to rise from the dead for judgment. See 39:68.\n1253] This refers to Al-Walîd ibn Al-Mughîrah, a leader of Meccan\nopposition against Islam. See footnote for 64:10-16.\n1254] Another possible translation: “It spares none and leaves nothing.”\n1255] Some pagans made fun of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) when they were told\nthat the keepers of Hell are nineteen angels. One of them said mockingly\nto other pagans, “You take care of two angels and I will vanquish the rest\nall by myself.”\n1256] Another possible translation: “In fact, each of them wishes to be given a\nscripture open ˹for all to read˺.” See 6:124.\n1257] This refers to the fact that every human has a unique set of fingerprints.\n[1258] They both will rise from the west and lose their light.\n[1259] Their organs will testify against them. See 41:19-24.\n\n-- 689 of 694 --\n\n1260] ’Alaqah, meaning the embryo resembles a leech.\n1261] This is the time before a human comes into being and as an embryo.\n1262] The mixture of male and female gametes (sperm and egg) which form\nthe zygote after fertilization.\n1263] There will be no day or night, sun or moon, winter or summer in\nParadise. It will always be bright and temperate.\n1264] The word\nṭahûr implies that once the believers take that pure drink,\nthere will be no bad feelings in their hearts or ailments in their bodies.\n1265] This verse refers to the five daily prayers: the dawn prayer, then noon\nand afternoon prayers, then sunset and late evening prayers, respectively.\n1266] Extra prayers offered at night. See 73:20.\n[1267] See 23:12-14 and 22:5.\n1268] lit., yellow camels. Black camels’ hair glistens yellow in sunlight.\n1269] The pagans used to mock the teachings of the Quran (e.g., resurrection\nand judgment). They disagreed whether the Quran was magic, poetry, or\nfortune-telling.\n1270] Just like tent pegs and icebergs, mountains go deep below the surface,\nslowing tectonic movement.\n[1271] i.e., the angel Gabriel.\n1272] In the Hereafter, Allah will judge between all of His creation including\nanimals, which will eventually become dust. The wicked will wish that\nthey too were turned into dust so they do not have to go to the Fire, as\nreported in an authentic narration collected by Al-Ḥakim.\n1273] The first Blast will cause everyone to die except those spared by Allah.\nThen the second one will cause the dead to come to life for judgment. See\n39:68.\n1274] The staff turning into a snake. See 20:17-23.\n1275] This is from a human perspective. Otherwise, both the creation of the\nuniverse and the resurrection of humans are easy for Allah.\n1276] The Arabic verb daḥa also suggests that the earth is egg-shaped. The\nnoun form diḥya is still used in some Arab dialects to mean an egg.\nBased on 2:29, 41:9-12, and 79:27-33, Allah ordained both realms, then\nformed the earth and created its provisions, then formed the heaven into\nseven heavens—all in six ˹heavenly˺ Days. See footnote for 7:54.\n\n-- 690 of 694 --\n\n1277] This is the second Blast which will cause the dead to come to life for\njudgment. See 39:68.\n1278] Another possible translation: “What is this question? You ˹O Prophet˺\nare one of its signs.” It is believed—based on authentic narrations from\nthe Prophet—that he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is one of the signs of the Day of Judgment.\n1279] This passage, along with others that are critical of some things the\nProphet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) did (such as 66:1), proves that the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\ndelivered the revelations in all honesty.\n1280] The way to true guidance or the way out of their mothers’ wombs.\n1281] Burial is perceived as a way of honouring human beings after their\ndeath.\n1282] This is the second Blast which will cause the dead to come to life for\njudgment. See 39:68.\n1283] Ten-month pregnant camels were the most precious thing for nomadic\nArabs. These camels were always cared for and treasured.\n1284] All animals will be brought together for judgment and then they will be\nreduced to dust.\n1285] On the Day of Judgment the oceans and seas will be on fire.\n1286] Some pagan Arabs used to bury their infant daughters alive for fear of\nshame or poverty. This practice was condemned and abolished by Islam.\nSee 16:58-59.\n1287] This probably refers to black holes. Kanasa means to sweep or hide.\nMiknasah is derived from this, and is the standard word for a vacuum\ncleaner.\n[1288] lit., the day as it takes its first breath.\n[1289] i.e., Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n1290] This is first time the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) saw Gabriel in his angelic form.\nHe saw him a second time in heaven during the Night Journey. See 53:5-\n15.\n[1291] See 26:210-212.\n1292] Sijjîn is the name of a place (such as a confinement) in the depths of\nHell.\n1293] This is based on the commentary of Ibn Kathîr.\n[1294] ’Illiyûn is an elevated place in Paradise.\n\n-- 691 of 694 --\n\n[1295] i.e., treasures and dead bodies.\n1296] You will pass from life to death and from death to resurrection, from\nwell-being to sickness and from sickness to well-being, from poverty to\nrichness and from richness to poverty, etc.\n[1297] lit., they do not prostrate.\n1298] The witness can be Allah, the angels, or the prophets, and the witnessed\ncan be the people standing for judgment or the overwhelming events of\nJudgment Day.\n1299] Testes and ovaries are formed in the abdomen of the fetus during the\nfirst weeks of pregnancy, before descending to their permanent place in\nthe pelvis. Both are sustained by arteries originating between the\nbackbone and the ribcage.\n1300] Meaning, We will have you memorize the revelations and apply the\nrulings contained in them, unless one ruling is replaced by another.\n1301] The Islamic way of life which brings about ease in this life and\nsalvation in the next.\n1302] Another possible translation: “Do they not ever reflect on rainclouds—\nhow they are formed?”\n1303] With the exception of some mountains and hills in some parts of the\nworld, the earth has been smoothed out, making it easy for people to live,\nfarm, and travel.\n1304] The Hellfire is the major punishment. The minor punishment includes\ndisasters in this life as well as torments in the grave. See 32:21.\n1305] Like many sûrahs, this one begins with an oath from Allah. He has the\nright to swear by any object of His creation (i.e., the sun, the moon, the\nstars, the dawn, or the angels). As for us, we are only allowed to swear by\nAllah alone.\n1306] This refers to the first ten days of the month of Ⱬul-Ḥijjah, in which the\nrituals of pilgrimage are performed.\n[1307] i.e., pyramids and obelisks.\n1308] lit., so your Lord poured on them a whip of punishment.\n1309] They take over the inheritance of orphans and women.\n1310] Another possible translation: “None has ever punished the way He will\npunish on that Day, nor has anyone bound the way He will bind.”\n\n-- 692 of 694 --\n\n1311] Other sûrahs describing the people of the right and the people of the left\ninclude 56 and 69.\n[1312] Or “… when it reflects the sun’s light.”\n1313] It is true that while Qudâr ibn Sâlif was the individual who killed the\ncamel, the rest of the people were supportive of what he did, so they were\nall punished collectively.\n1314] And, by extension, anyone asking for help.\n1315] The Prophet’s name is always mentioned in the call to prayer, along\nwith Allah’s Name. Close to the end of each of the five daily prayers,\nworshippers invoke Allah’s blessings upon the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his\nfamily. When someone reverts to Islam, they testify that Allah is their\nLord and Muḥammad is His Messenger. Muslims, even those who are\nnot practicing, love the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and many name their children\nafter him.\n1316] If a definite noun is repeated in Arabic, it means that we are referring to\nthe same thing. For example, “I met the man and I gave the man some\nmoney.” But if an indefinite noun is repeated, it means we are referring to\ntwo different things. For example, “I met a man and I gave a man some\nmoney.” With this in mind, we realize that 94:5-6 refers to one hardship\n(a definite noun) and two different eases (an indefinite noun). Hence, the\nArabic saying: “Two eases cannot be overcome by one hardship.”\n1317] This passage refers to the land of figs and olives where Jesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)\nlived, Mount Sinai where Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) communicated with Allah, and\nthe city of Mecca where the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) started his mission. A\nsimilar reference can be found in Deuteronomy 33:1, ˹Moses\nproclaimed:˺ “The Lord came from Sinai. Rising from Seir upon us, he\n[sic] shone forth from Mount Paran.” Seir is a mountain near Jerusalem,\nand Paran is a mountain near Mecca.\n1318] The New American Standard Bible, copyright © 1960-1995 by the\nLockman Foundation.\n1319] ’Alaq, meaning the embryo resembles a leech.\n1320] Abu Jahl was a staunch leader of the Meccan opposition to Islam. There\nare many authentic stories of his abuse of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).\n1321] This refers to the frontal lobe of the brain, where reasoning is\nprocessed.\n\n-- 693 of 694 --\n\n1322] It is also believed that the angels descend with all decreed matters for\nthe whole year during that night (al-qadr also means ordainment or\ndestiny).\n[1323] i.e., the angel Gabriel.\n1324] lit., burdens (i.e., treasures and dead bodies).\n1325] The believers will head to Paradise and the disbelievers will head to\nHell.\n1326] lit., visited the graves, since the stay in the grave is brief, followed by\neternal life either in Paradise or Hell.\n1327] Other possible translations: 1. “The Fire will be in towering columns.”\n2. “They will be tied to long pillars.”\n[1328] Or worm-eaten leaves.\n1329] Quraysh is another name for the people of Mecca.\n1330] Blessing the people of Quraysh with provision and security is probably\nthe answer to Abraham’s prayer in 14:35-37.\n1331] They refuse to help others with small things like salt or water, let alone\nalms-tax.\n1332] This includes a heavenly river as well other favours in both worlds.\n1333] Since she used to carry thorny branches and throw them in the way of\nthe Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), she will be carrying firewood in Hell.\n1334] This was one of the earliest sûrahs revealed of the Quran.\nParadoxically, for Abu Lahab to disprove the Quran, all he had to do was\naccept Islam because this verse condemns him to Hell.\n1335] As mentioned in the Introduction, the Quran has three main themes: 1.\nStories. 2. Muslim teachings. 3. And belief in the unseen. Since Sûrah\n112 covers the third theme, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) says in a\t\nḥadîth\ncollected by Bukhâri and Muslim that reading this sûrah equals reading\none third of the Quran.\n\n-- 694 of 694 --\n\n"
