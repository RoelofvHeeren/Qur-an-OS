    "intro": "This Meccan sûrah, which is recited a total of seventeen times in the five daily prayers, serves as the cornerstone of the Quran. It sums up the relationship between the Creator and His creation, Allah’s undisputed authority in this world and the Hereafter, and humanity’s constant dependence on Him for guidance and assistance. The underlying theme is to acknowledge that He is the only god worthy of worship—a simple truth which the disbelievers fail to grasp. All fundamental principles encapsulated in this sûrah are spelled out in the rest of the Quran. Prayer for Guidance",

    "intro": "This Medinian sûrah, which takes its name from the story of the cow in verses 67–73, details the main concepts of the previous sûrah, with emphasis on the qualities of the believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites; Allah’s power to create and resurrect; the enmity of Satan towards Adam ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his descendants; as well as Allah’s covenant with Moses ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and the Children of Israel. Several rulings are given in regards to marital relationships, bequest, jihad, fasting, pilgrimage, donations, debts, and interest. Unlike the next sûrah, which focuses on the Christian perception of Jesus, this sûrah dedicates a sizable portion to Jewish attitudes and practices. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Qualities of the Believers",

    "intro": "This Medinian sûrah takes its name from the Family of ’Imrân mentioned in verse 33. Like the previous sûrah, it reiterates the fact that Allah is the source of divine revelation and affirms the belief in Allah as the only Lord and Islam as His only accepted religion. The story of the birth of Mary, John the Baptist, and Jesus is mentioned, along with a challenge to the Christian perception of Jesus ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). The sûrah also touches on early battles against the Meccan pagans with emphasis on the lessons to be drawn from the Muslims’ defeat at the Battle of U ḥud, which took place in 3 A.H./625 C.E. The virtue of being mindful of Allah is highlighted at the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next one.

As the sûrah progresses, the focus shifts to the etiquette of striving in the cause of Allah and the relationship between Muslims and the People of the Book, culminating in a rebuttal to the claims about the crucifixion and divinity of Jesus ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Like the previous and the next sûrahs, this sûrah also deals with the issue of hypocrisy—a common theme in many other Medinian sûrahs.

Several rulings are laid out, including permissible and prohibited foods, hunting while on pilgrimage, and making a bequest while travelling. A reference is made to Allah’s covenants with the Jews and Christians and how those covenants were repeatedly violated. The believers are urged to comply with Allah’s judgment as communicated by the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Some topics that have been touched on in the previous sûrahs are detailed here, including making up for a broken oath, the sanctity of the human life, and the humanity of Jesus ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).

Like many other Meccan sûrahs, it recounts the stories of earlier prophets who were denied by their own people and how the deniers were eventually destroyed. As mentioned in the previous sûrah (6:10-11), these stories are meant to reassure the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and warn his people of Allah’s torment. The story of Satan’s arrogance and Adam’s temptation and fall are detailed, along with lessons for the believers to beware of Satan’s whispers. Details about Paradise and Hell (verses 36-53) here are unmatched by any previous sûrah. The powerlessness of idols is further emphasized. Full obedience to Allah and His prophets is stressed in this sûrah and the next. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Advice to the Prophet",

    "intro": "This sûrah was revealed in Medina to explain how the spoils of war should be distributed following the believers’ victory over the Meccan pagans at Badr in 2 A.H./624 C.E. The sûrah urges the believers to be true to Allah and His Messenger, reminding them of how they were outnumbered but Allah sent down angels for their aid. It is made clear that although victory comes only from Allah, the believers should always be ready to defend themselves and be open for peace. The pagans are warned that their plots to hinder others from Allah’s Way and oppose the truth will only end in failure—a theme emphasized in both the previous and the following sûrahs. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Distribution of Spoils of War[338]",

The believers are urged to march forth with the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) for the Battle of Tabûk in the summer of 9 A.H./631 C.E. Hypocrites are exposed and their false excuses are refuted. Muslims are reminded of how Allah turned the believers’ initial defeat into sweeping victory at the Battle of Ḥunain and how Allah saved His Messenger ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) from the pagans during his migration to Medina.

    "intro": "Similar to the previous sûrah, this Meccan sûrah emphasizes Allah’s acceptance of repentance, most notably in the case of the people of Jonah (verse 98). The pagan claims against the Quran are refuted both in this sûrah and the next. The short span of this worldly life and people’s ingratitude to their Creator are elaborated upon. The Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is urged to exercise patience in the face of denial. The stories of Noah’s people and Pharaoh’s people are cited as cautionary tales to the Meccan deniers, setting the stage for more elaborate warnings in the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Universal Messenger",

    "intro": "Rightfully called ‘the best of stories,’ this uplifting Meccan sûrah was revealed along with the two previous sûrahs at a critical time in the life of the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) following the death of his wife Khadîjah and his uncle Abu Ṭâlib, his two main supporters, shortly after a 3-year boycott by the Meccan pagans to suppress the believers. This is the story of Joseph ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) whose half-brothers were driven by jealousy, conspiring to distance him from his father Jacob ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt, falsely accused, and imprisoned for several years, only to become Egypt’s Chief Minister. Just like Joseph ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had to live away from his hometown, was faced with false allegations and abused by his own people, but ultimately became Arabia’s undisputed leader. When the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) triumphed over Mecca after many years of persecution, he treated the very people who abused him with grace, recalling the words of Joseph when his brothers begged for mercy in verse 92, “There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you! He is the Most Merciful of the merciful!” In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful The Best of Stories",

Instead of showing gratitude to Allah for all these blessings, the pagans wilfully set up idols, associating them with Allah in worship. They are also condemned for burying their daughters alive (verses 58-59). References are made to grateful believers and ungrateful disbelievers along with the ultimate reward for each group. Abraham ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is cited close to the end of the sûrah as a grateful servant of Allah, whose example should be emulated by all believers. The sûrah concludes by instructing the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to endure patiently and invite all to the Way of Allah with wisdom and grace.

He ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) will also be honoured on the Day of Judgment through the station of praise where he will make intercession (verse 79). The children of Israel are referred to passingly at the end of the previous sûrah, but more insights are given about them both at the beginning and the end of this sûrah. The key to success in this life and salvation in the next is encapsulated in a set of divine commandments (verses 22-39), along with a warning against Satan and his whispers (verses 61-65). The sûrah is critical of the pagan arguments against resurrection and their ridiculous demands (verses 89-93). Criticism of attributing partners and children to Allah is carried over to the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem",

The Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) says in an authentic narration collected by At- Tirmi ⱬi, “No one’s feet will move on Judgment Day until they are asked about four things: 1) What they did in their youth. 2) How they earned and spent their wealth. 3) What they did with their knowledge. 4) And how they spent their lives.” Interestingly, these four questions correspond to the four stories mentioned in this sûrah: 1) The story of the youths and the cave. 2) The story of the wealthy man with two gardens. 3) The story of Moses and the man of knowledge. 4) And finally the story of Ⱬul-Qarnain and his life and travels in the service of Allah. The four stories are interjected by warnings to the disbelievers and good news to the believers. Like the story of the people of the cave, some miraculous stories appear in the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Message of the Quran",

This Meccan sûrah reassures the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) that the truth always prevails even against the most tyrannical opposition (in the form of Pharaoh) and that Allah is able to open even the hardest of hearts (in the form of Pharaoh’s magicians). Both the beginning and the end of the sûrah emphasize the divine nature of the Quran as a source of guidance and eternal bliss. Those who turn away from the Quranic reminder are warned of misery in this world and horrifying punishment on the Day of Judgment. The Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is advised to seek comfort in patience and prayer against pagan denial, which is detailed at the beginning of the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Almighty Allah’s Revelation",

    "intro": "This Medinian sûrah takes its name from the passage that talks about pilgrimage rituals (verses 25-37), along with condemnations to the pagans for hindering the believers from reaching the Sacred House in Mecca. After fifteen years of persecution, here the believers receive the permission to fight back in self-defence (verse 39). Idolatry is condemned and the idols are rejected as pathetic, incapable of even creating a fly. In conclusion, the believers are told that they can achieve success through prayer and good deeds—a theme which extends to the beginning of the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful The Horror of Judgment Day",

A large portion of this sûrah deals with the issue of sexual misconduct hinted at in the previous sûrah (23:7). The sûrah also offers some guidelines to the believers on how they should have reacted to false rumours against ’ Ȃishah, the Prophet’s wife. Other issues are discussed, including modesty, entering people’s homes, forced prostitution, hypocrisy, and false accusations of adultery. Allah’s power, compliance with His judgment, and obedience to the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) are highly emphasized. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful The Introduction",

Since the previous sûrah ends with a warning to the deniers of the truth, this sûrah recounts several cautionary tales of destroyed deniers such as Pharaoh and the peoples of Noah, Shu’aib, Lot, and Ṣâli ḥ. The divine origin of the Quran is emphasized at both ends of the sûrah. The qualities of the believers mentioned in the last verse (227) are elaborated upon at the beginning of the next sûrah.

Unlike the previous sûrah, this Meccan sûrah focuses on these two aspects of Moses’ life in Egypt, along with his escape to Midian where he met his future wife. Another aspect is the story of Korah, one of the people of Moses, who behaved arrogantly, leading to his own destruction. Just like the previous sûrah, it reaffirms Allah’s power and the authenticity of the Quran. Again, the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reminded that his duty is not to convert, but to convey. After criticizing the polytheists (verses 45-75), the sûrah concludes by bidding the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to be steadfast. The next sûrah starts off by talking about steadfastness. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Pharaoh’s Tyranny",

The beginning of the sûrah emphasizes the role of trials and tribulations in revealing those who are truly steadfast and those who are not. Noah, Abraham, Lot, and Shu’aib are noted for their perseverance. References are made to various peoples and the different ways they were destroyed for their denial of the truth (verse 40). The pagan arguments against the Prophet and the Quran are thoroughly refuted. The sûrah concludes by commending those who put their trust in Allah and strive in His cause. This conclusion paves the way for the opening of the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful The Test",

    "intro": "This Meccan sûrah takes its name from the reference to the Romans in verse 2. The world’s superpowers in the early 7th century were the Roman Byzantine and Persian Empires. When they went to war in 614 C.E., the Romans suffered a devastating defeat. The Meccan pagans rejoiced at the defeat of the Roman Christians at the hands of the Persian pagans. Soon verses 30:1-5 were revealed, stating that the Romans would be victorious in three to nine years. Eight years later, the Romans won a decisive battle against the Persians, reportedly on the same day the Muslims vanquished the Meccan army at the Battle of Badr. As the sûrah progresses, several blessings and natural signs are cited to prove Allah’s infinite mercy and power, coupled with condemnations to the pagans for their ingratitude and for associating powerless idols with Allah in worship. The sûrah closes by bidding the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) not to be disheartened by what the deniers say. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful From Defeat to Victory",

While the believers are praised, the pagans are condemned for their ingratitude, distracting others from the Way of Allah, and for setting up idols as His equals. Similar to the previous sûrah, references are made to Allah’s natural marvels, challenging the deniers to point out anything their gods have created.

While the believers are reminded of Allah’s aid against the enemy alliance, the hypocrites are condemned repeatedly. The sûrah provides social guidelines regarding adoption, divorce, modesty, and the etiquette of dealing with the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his wives. In view of Allah’s favours to the believers (including His forgiveness and generous reward at the end of the sûrah), the next sûrah starts off with praises to Allah.

The Meccan pagans are reminded that only faith can bring them closer to Allah, not their wealth. They are criticized for calling the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) ‘insane’ and are warned of punishment in this life and the next. Both the last part of this sûrah (verses 40-41) and the beginning of the next (verse 1) reaffirm the angels as Allah’s faithful servants.

Hence, several examples of destroyed disbelievers are cited here, including the peoples of Noah, Lot, and Elias. Some basic truths are emphasized, including the oneness of Allah, the Resurrection, and the prophethood of Mu ḥammad ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). The pagans are criticized for calling the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) ‘a mad poet’ and for claiming that the angels are Allah’s daughters. This sûrah provides more details on the punishment of the disbelievers and the reward of the believers in the Hereafter (verses 19- 68). In conclusion, the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reassured that Allah’s messengers always prevail. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful One God Only",

Again, the pagans are condemned for denying the oneness of Allah, rejecting the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) as ‘a magician, a total liar,’ and for claiming that the world was created without purpose. Reference is made to the creation of Adam ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and the enmity Satan has for him and his descendants (verses 71-85), and the punishment awaiting the misleaders and their followers (verses 55-64), contrasted with the bliss in store for the righteous (verses 49-54).

Eventually, following a fair judgment, the former will be led to their places in Paradise and the latter to their places in Hell—each in successive groups (hence the sûrah’s name).

All this is embodied in the story of Moses (verses 23-54)—with Pharaoh as the ungrateful disbeliever and an unidentified man from Pharaoh’s people as the grateful believer. The Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is repeatedly advised to be patient, keeping in mind that Allah never lets His prophets down (verses 51 and 77). In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful The Quran Is from the Almighty",

The deniers are warned that their own bodily organs will testify against them on Judgment Day, landing them in Hell forever. Reference to the destruction of the arrogant, ungrateful peoples of ’ Ȃd and Thamûd is made because the pagan Arabs used to pass by their ruins on their journeys to Syria and Yemen, respectively. A profound description of the righteous is given in verses 30-36. The truth of the Quran is emphasized at the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful The Deniers of the Truth",

    "intro": "This Meccan sûrah takes its name from verse 38 which talks about conducting affairs by mutual consultation as one of the qualities of the true believers. The sûrah emphasizes that Allah has decreed for Muslims the same religion ordained for all the previous prophets. The believers are commanded to resort to Allah’s judgment if disagreement arises. Allah’s oneness, power, and wisdom are emphasized as the pagans’ faith in powerless idols is condemned. Both the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next stress the fact that the Quran has been revealed by Allah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Allah Almighty",

The pagans are scorned for following their forefathers blindly, labelling the angels as Allah’s daughters, claiming that Mu ḥammad ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is not worthy to receive revelations because he is not rich, and for associating idols with Allah in worship, although they admit that He is the sole Creator of the heavens and the earth.

Similar to the previous sûrah, the Meccan pagans are equated with Pharaoh’s people for going back on their promise of full submission to Allah once the plague is removed from them. The Quran is said to have been revealed on a blessed night for the guidance of humanity. Those who embrace its guidance will be honoured in Paradise and those who reject it will be debased in Hell. This fate is the underlying theme in the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful The Quran as a Mercy",

Again, Allah’s infinite power is contrasted with the powerlessness of the idols. The pagan arguments against the Quran and the Resurrection are refuted, and reference is made to a group of jinn who readily embraced the truth once they heard the Prophet’s recitation of the Quran. The Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is urged to be patient, and reminded of the fate awaiting those who challenge the truth at the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next.

He ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) sent ’Uthmân ibn ’Affân to let the Meccans know that the Muslims had come in peace, only to visit the Sacred House. When the Meccans delayed ’Uthmân, the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) thought they might have killed his envoy. So he ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) called upon the faithful to pledge allegiance to him under a tree at Ḥudaibiyah in the outskirts of Mecca. Shortly after, ’Uthmân returned safely and a peace agreement was signed by the Muslims and Meccan pagans, stating in part that the Muslims would have to return to Medina and come back next year for ’umrah. The Treaty of Ḥudaibiyah is described as a clear triumph since it established peace, temporarily diffused the tension between the Muslims and the Meccan pagans, and gave the Muslims plenty of time to spread awareness and understanding of their faith. Thousands from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce. The sûrah commends the believers for proving true to Allah and His Messenger, criticizes the hypocrites for not marching forth with the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), and condemns the pagans for denying the believers access to the Sacred House. The description of the true believers both in the Torah and the Gospel is given at the end of the sûrah, followed by instructions on proper conduct with the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and other believers in the next sûrah.

Atheism is also rejected (verses 25-36). The Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reassured of Allah’s support, while the pagan beliefs and arguments are refuted both in this sûrah and the next.

The pagans are condemned for associating idols with Allah in worship and for claiming that the angels are Allah’s daughters. Manifestations of Allah’s infinite power are cited to prove His ability to resurrect. Both the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next stress the imminence of the Hour.

Similar to the next sûrah, a strong emphasis is placed on Allah’s knowledge and power. It is made clear that Allah is able to revive faith in the hearts of the believers just as He can revive the earth after its death. The believers are advised regarding destiny and the life of this world, while the hypocrites are warned of the evil fate awaiting them. Some prophets are mentioned passingly before making a final invitation to the People of the Book to believe in Allah and His Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).

    "intro": "A companion named Khawlah bint Tha’labah had a disagreement with her husband, Aws ibn A ṣ- Ṣâmit, who then told her that she was as unlawful for him as the ẓahr (back) of his mother. This statement had been considered to be a form of divorce (known as ẓihâr) in Arabia. Khawlah came to the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to ask for his opinion. He ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) told her that he had not received any revelation in this regard, and that, based on tradition, she was divorced. She argued that she and her husband had children together who would suffer if their parents were separated. Then she started to plead to Allah as the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) repeated the same answer. Eventually, this Medinian sûrah was revealed in response to her pleas, thereby abolishing this ancient practice. The sûrah emphasizes Allah’s infinite knowledge and overwhelming power, and makes it clear that those who ally themselves with Allah and comply with His orders are bound to prevail, whereas those who challenge Him and ally themselves with His enemies will be debased and vanquished. This concept is elaborated upon in the next sûrah (verses 59:1-4 and 11-17). In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful The Case of Khawlah",

    "intro": "This Medinian sûrah was revealed prior to the Prophet’s conquest of Mecca following the pagans’ violation of the peace treaty they had signed with the Muslims at Ḥudaibiyah. Despite the Prophet’s orders to keep this plan secret, a companion by the name of Ḥâṭib ibn Abi Balta’ah sent a warning letter to the Meccans, hoping that in turn they would protect his family— who were still in Mecca—in case the Muslims failed to enter the city. Soon the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received a revelation about what Ḥâṭib did. The letter was intercepted, and Ḥâṭib was later forgiven. Mecca surrendered peacefully to the Muslims, and its residents were pardoned by the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Muslims are instructed to be loyal to Allah and fellow believers, following the example of Prophet Abraham ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) (verses 4-6). The believers are not forbidden from courtesy to non-Muslims as long as they are not persecuting Muslims (verses 8-9). This sûrah takes its name from testing the faith of women fleeing Mecca by asking them, for example, if they have emigrated for Islam or only to be separated from their pagan husbands (verse 10). Other instructions to the believers are given at the end of this sûrah and the beginning of the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Allying with the Enemy",

Since the disciples of Jesus ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) are commended in the previous sûrah (61:14), the companions of Mu ḥammad ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) are honoured in this sûrah (verses 2-4).

It so happened that he stayed longer than usual at the home of Zainab bint Ja ḥsh, where he was offered honey—something he liked very much. Out of jealousy, two other wives ( Ḥaf ṣah and ’ Ȃishah) agreed between themselves to tell the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), when he visited each of them, that his mouth gave off a bad smell, knowing that he ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) did not like bad smells. Eventually, the Prophet made an oath that he would never eat honey again, and told Ḥaf ṣah not to tell anyone about this. But she told ’ Ȃishah that their plan worked. Both wives are subtly advised to learn from the example of the two believing women mentioned at the end of the sûrah— Mary and Ȃsiyah, the wife of Pharaoh—and take a lesson from the fate of the wives of Noah and Lot, who were both destroyed despite being wives of prophets. The believers are urged in this sûrah to mend their ways and genuinely repent to Allah in order to win His eternal reward, whereas the disbelievers are warned of a horrible fate. The fate of the disbelievers is elaborated upon in the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful A Lesson to the Prophet’s Wives",

    "intro": "In a ḥadîth collected by At-Tirmi ⱬi, a blind man by the name of ’Abdullâh ibn Um Maktûm, an early Muslim, came to the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) seeking to learn more about the faith, while the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was in the middle of a discussion with an elite Meccan pagan, trying to convince him to abandon his idols and believe in the One True God. ’Abdullâh was so impatient that he interrupted the discussion several times. The Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) frowned and turned all his attention to the man he was already talking to. This Meccan sûrah was later revealed, telling the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) that he should have tended to the faithful man who was eager to learn. After this sûrah was revealed, the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) would honour ’Abdullâh, calling him ‘the man for whom my Lord rebuked me.’ He ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) even appointed him several times as his deputy over Medina. The sûrah calls upon the ungrateful disbelievers to reflect on how Allah produces plants out of the earth to realize how He can bring the dead out of their graves. The description of the horrors of the apocalypse is carried over to the next sûrah. In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful A Lesson to the Prophet[1279]",

The Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was retreating at a cave in the outskirts of Mecca when the angel Gabriel appeared to him, squeezing him tightly and ordering him to read. Since the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was unlettered, he responded, “I cannot read.” Ultimately, Gabriel taught him: “Read in the Name of your Lord …” Some scholars believe that this encounter is the fulfilment of Isaiah 29:12, which states, “Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, ‘Read this.’ And he will say, ‘I cannot read.’”[1318] The rest of the sûrah was later revealed to deter Abu Jahl, a Meccan pagan elite, from abusing the Prophet ( ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص).

        "text": "*** COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT ISLAM What Is Islam? Islam did not start with Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the 7th century. Technically, Islam is the message that was delivered by all the prophets of Allah from Adam (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Islam is neither named after a person or a tribe nor does it end with an –ism. Though each prophet had a relatively different law, the essence of the message of Islam was always the same: have faith in one God and do good. In the Bible, the first four of the Ten Commandments enjoin the worship of one God; the rest urge believers to avoid what is wrong and to do what is good. All prophets and their followers (including Jesus and his disciples) are simply called “Muslims” in the Quran. Hence, anyone who submits to Allah and strives to be a good person can be called a ‘muslim’ (with a small ‘m’) from a linguistic perspective. Every human being is born with the innate will (fi ṭrah) to submit to Allah, but parents and society change this nature, and in order to relate to the Almighty, many have put a face on God (mostly human or animal) throughout history. The process of restoring the fi ṭrah is called reversion. Islam is not only a religion, but a comprehensive way of life. Based on common sense and clear-cut teachings, Islam defines the rights and responsibilities of every individual in regards to their relationship with Allah and His creation. It balances the spiritual and material needs of its followers and helps them gain happiness in this life and salvation in the next. Who Is a Muslim? A ‘Muslim’ (with a capital ‘M’) is someone who practices Islam. Muslims follow the five pillars of Islam: -Shahâdah, testifying that there is only One God and Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is His last Prophet - Ṣalâh, praying five times a day - Ṣawm, fasting from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramaḍân -Zakâh, paying alms-tax on savings worth 85 g of gold or more, if the amount is kept for a year - Ḥajj, performing pilgrimage to Mecca, if physically and financially able to. Muslims also believe in the six articles of faith: -Almighty Allah -His angels -His prophets -His scriptures -Free choice, fate, and destiny -The Day of Judgment Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. Totalling 1.6 billion, Muslims make up one-quarter of the world’s population. Muslims come from different ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds. Contrary to the common belief, not all Muslims are Arab; not all Arabs are Muslim. Arabs make up less than 18% of the world’s Muslim population. Indonesia (a single non-Arab Muslim country in Southeast Asia) has more Muslims than all Arab countries combined. Islam should not be judged by what any Muslim does, but Muslims should be judged based on what Islam teaches. Islam is perfect; Muslims are not. Who Is Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)? The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was born in Mecca in the year 570 C.E. His father died before his birth and his mother died when he was six years old. As he grew up, he acquired the epithet ‘the trustworthy.’ Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had long detested the idolatry, social injustice, and corruption found in society. At the age of forty, he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received the first revelation of the Quran from Allah through the angel Gabriel. Since the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) could not read or write, he had scribes write down passages over the course of their revelation. The Quran was also memorized word for word by the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and many of his companions. Although the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) performed many miracles, such as the splitting of the moon (see ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص 54:1), water gushing out from between his fingers, multiplying food, still the Quran is his greatest miracle. Just like many previous prophets, Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his early followers were persecuted—and some were even killed—for advocating revolutionary ideas such as social justice and women’s rights. As the persecution grew fierce, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and many of his companions emigrated to the city of Medina, 260 miles to the north of Mecca. This emigration (Hijrah) marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. After several years, Mecca ultimately surrendered peacefully to Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) who issued a universal amnesty. Before the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) passed away at the age of sixty-three, the greater part of the Arabian Peninsula had become Muslim, and within a century of his death, Islam had spread to Spain in the west and as far east as China. The rapid spread of Islam (especially to territories previously occupied by the Byzantine and Persian empires) was mostly because of its simple teachings and social justice. Why Do Muslims Call God ‘Allah’? Arab Muslims, Christians, and Jews call God ‘Allah.’ The word ‘Allah’ is unique in the sense that it has no plural or gender. It literally means in Arabic “the One, True God.” Allah has many attributes and beautiful names such as the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, the All-Loving, the Judge, the Creator, and the Provider. In his native tongue of Aramaic, Jesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) used Alaha to refer to Allah. Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) used, among other things, Eloh in Hebrew. Allah, Alaha, and Eloh come from three Semitic languages: Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew respectively. What Is the Quran? The Quran is the holy book of Islam. It is a collection of revelations that were received by the Prophet Muhammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) over the course of twenty-three years in the 7th century C.E. There is only one version of the Quran, perfectly preserved in written and oral records around the world for nearly 1400 years. The Quran is the only book in history that has been memorized verbatim by millions of people. Sûrahs were written down separately during ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص the life of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and were collected in one volume within two years of his death. Exact copies were later duplicated from the original collection during the reign of the 3rd Caliph, ’Uthmân ibn ’Affân, and sent to major Muslim cities. Today, all copies of the Quran (called ma ṣâḥif, plural of mu ṣḥaf) are perfect duplicates of the original. The Quran emphasizes universal ethics such as honesty, sincerity, generosity, mercy, and standing up for what is right. It aims at humanizing humanity and deifying Allah and therefore condemns those who personify Allah and idolize their fellow created beings. Was the Quran Copied from the Bible? It is worth mentioning that the first Arabic translation of the Bible was done centuries after the Prophet’s death. From an Islamic point of view, similarities between the Quran and the Bible (especially historical stories such as that of Joseph, Moses, and Jesus) stem from the fact that both scriptures came originally from the same source—divine revelation. Because of differences in transmission and interpretation of the Bible, over time the stories changed. The Quranic narratives now appear slightly different, for example, unlike the Quran (20:120-122), in the book of Genesis, Eve was tempted to eat from the tree and therefore she is to blame for the Fall. Also, according to the Quran (Sûrah 19), prophets are infallible of sin. But in the Bible, some prophets are guilty of shameful and even criminal acts. For example, David impregnated his neighbour’s wife (Bathsheba) before conspiring to get her husband (Uriah) killed (II Samuel 11:1-27), Lot had sex with his two daughters (Genesis 19:30-38), and Noah got drunk and naked (Genesis 9:20-21). Some Biblical stories are not in the Quran and vice versa. For example, the Biblical story of Isaiah is not in the Quran, while the story of Moses and Al-Khaḍir mentioned in Sûrah 18 of the Quran is not in the Bible. Also, there are three miracles of Jesus in the Quran that are not in the Bible (see 5:110-115). Although both scriptures emphasize global ethics (such as dignity, kindness, and charity), each revolves around a different theology. Both have contrasting views on the perception of Allah, Jesus, salvation, crucifixion, and the original sin. Is Islam Compatible with Science? Although the Quran is a book of signs, not a book of science, there are many scientific references in the Quran such as the formation and developmental phases of an embryo in the uterus (23:12–14 and 22:5), the Big Bang (21:30), the constant expansion of the universe (51:47–8), spherical shape of the earth (39:5 and 79:30), the earth’s rotation (27:88), and many others that have become known only in the last two centuries. According to an Arab proverb, “The ink of a scholar is holier than the blood of a martyr.” Islam’s emphasis on education galvanized learning and science in the Muslim world culminating in what is known as the Islamic Golden Age. For centuries, Muslims pioneered medicine, anatomy, mathematics, geography, astronomy, architecture, and many other sciences. Algebra, alchemy, and alcohol are all Arabic words. The Canon of Medicine by Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037 C.E.) was a primary medical text in medieval Europe for more than 700 years. Many surgical tools that are in use today were invented by Albucasis (Alzahrâwi, 936-1013 C.E.). Mariam Al-Astrolabiya, a female Muslim scholar who lived in the 10th century in Syria, was famous for designing and constructing astrolabes. Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) are used worldwide. Muslims invented numerous sciences and developed many others (which they had inherited from the Romans, Greeks, Persians, Indians, and others) and laid the foundations to the European industrial revolution. The invention of cameras, computers, and navigation systems could not have been possible without the contributions of Muslim scholars. What Is Sharia Law? Linguistically, Sharia means a pathway. Technically, it is the Muslim law, derived mainly from the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), governing every aspect of a Muslim’s life. Sharia is made up of thousands of teachings and rulings covering theology, acts of worship, manners, human interactions, business transactions, family relations (marriage, divorce, inheritance, etc.), war and peace, belief in the unseen (Allah, angels, and the Hereafter), and criminal law. Sharia mainly aims at protecting 5 things: 1) Life 2) Honour 3) Freedom to practice one’s faith 4) Intellect 5) Property. Therefore, there are punishments in Islamic Law for violating any of these rights. Every country has punishments for offences—even though the penalty for the same crime may vary from one country to another. To say that Sharia is all about chopping people’s hands off is like saying that the American law is all about killing people with the electric chair! Sharia does not apply to non- Muslim minorities living in predominantly Muslim countries. Of the fifty- seven Muslim countries in the world, the great majority are secular, not Sharia-based. Muslims living in the West follow the law of the land and maintain Sharia mainly in personal matters (such as prayers, marriage, and inheritance). Sharia also forbids the consumption of pork, alcohol, and drugs. Smoking is frowned upon. Is Islam Compatible with Modern Democracy? We have to make the distinction between what Islam teaches and how countries in the Muslim world are run. As pointed out earlier, many Muslim countries are secular-based, not fully subscribing to Islamic morals or western democratic values. Islam and modern democracies have many things in common. For example, the fundamental principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are acceptable Islamically. What makes Islamic values unique is that they do not change over time, what is right in the sight of Allah is always right and what is wrong is always wrong. On the other hand, many secular freedoms (which have been mostly adopted in the last few decades) are still subject to debate in western societies. For example, marijuana, same-sex marriage, abortion, incest, and prostitution are legal in some democracies and illegal in some others. The same applies to euthanasia and the death penalty. Moreover, in a secular society, the majority’s opinion prevails. In the Islamic concept of shûra, the truth prevails even if it is held by a minority. For example, the segregation of blacks and whites under the Jim Crow Laws would be prohibited under Sharia, since discrimination based on colour goes against Islamic beliefs. Does Jihad Equal Terrorism? Life is sacred in Islam. The Quran (5:32) states, “Whoever takes a life …, it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity.” Those who manipulate verses from the Quran by taking them out of context to justify violence against innocents contradict the Quran’s call for tolerance and peaceful co-existence. Islam is unequivocally against terrorism (see 5:33). Jihad means to strive for a better, more righteous life. The major jihad is to overcome one’s desires (such as greed). Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) says, “The highest form of jihad is to speak a word of truth in the presence of a tyrant,” “Kindness to parents is a form of jihad,” and “Charity to orphans and widows is jihad.” The minor jihad is fighting in self-defence. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) set the etiquettes of fighting as follows: “Do not ask Allah to meet your enemies in battle” and “Do not start a war. If you must fight, then strike only at those ˹combatants˺ who attacked you. Do not attack women, children, the elderly, or those retreating in their places of worship. Do not cut down trees or kill animals.” We have to keep in mind that all violent passages in the Quran (including verses in sûrahs 2, 8, 9, 47, and 48) strictly concern conflicts between early Muslims and the pagans of Mecca over 1400 years ago. As such, all passages should be understood in their historical context. In Islam, fighting is allowed against aggressors regardless of their faith. Fighting against innocents is prohibited regardless of their faith. Overall, violent passages in the Quran talk about one of three things: -Fighting back in self-defence. -Making peace if attackers cease. -Or resuming the fight if a truce is violated. What is the Origin of Religious Violence? No religion condones the killing of innocents, but some people manipulate religion to justify acts of violence. So, even if Islam and other faiths have never existed, humans would have come up with other excuses to fight for domination. We have seen notorious anti-religion, secularist ideologies, like those championed by Mao and Stalin (the top mass murderers in modern history), which were responsible for over seventy million deaths in the 20th century. Most victims of violence in the Muslim world are Muslims, who are either killed by unjustified wars, suicide bombs, or drone attacks. Over the last few decades, hundreds of thousands have been killed—most of them civilians—and many others wounded or displaced. Justice, dignity, and education, some of the most fundamental aspects of human rights, are the key to peace and prosperity anywhere in the world. Are Women Abused in Islam? The Quran makes it clear that men and women are equal before Allah and the Law (16:97 and 33:35). Abuses against some Muslim women (e.g., honour killing and forced marriages) are cultural practices in some Muslim countries that contradict Islamic teachings. There are many prominent Muslim women in every field: education, science, business, etc. Several Muslim women have been elected president and prime minister in Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Turkey. The high status of women in Islam explains why 75% of reverts to Islam are women. Why Do Muslim Women Wear the Hijab? The veil is deeply rooted in all Abrahamic traditions. Christian icons such as Mary and Mother Teresa are always depicted with veils. In the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), both men and women are urged to be modest in their dress and behaviour. Hijab is worn by adult Muslim women in the presence of adult males outside of their immediate family. What Are the Rights of Non-Muslims in Islam? Islam guarantees the freedom of non-Muslims to practice their faith and protection for their places of worship. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said, “Whoever harms a non-Muslim under the protection of Islam, I shall be their opponent on Judgment Day and they will not even smell Paradise.” The Quran teaches that there are three types of brotherhood: brotherhood in humanity (this includes all human beings), biological brotherhood (one’s siblings), and brotherhood in faith (fellow Muslims). Islam allows giving charity to non-Muslims and exchanging gifts and visits with them. The Quran (60:8-9) exhorts Muslims to be kind and generous to non-Muslims. It forbids forcing non-Muslims to convert to Islam (2:256). For centuries, non-Muslim communities thrived under Muslim rule. Many Christians and Jews occupied prominent positions in the courts of some Muslim caliphs, serving as translators, physicians, and architects. Do Muslims Believe in Other Prophets? The Quran mentions twenty-five prophets by name—of whom five are given the honorary title of ‘the Messengers of Firm Resolve,’ namely Abraham, Noah, Moses, Jesus, and Muḥammad. The Quran (12:111) says, “In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason.” Some of the most common names in the Muslim world include ’Îsa (Jesus in Arabic), Mûsa (Moses), Mariam (Mary), Yûsuf (Joseph), and Ibrâhîm (Abraham). Jesus is mentioned by name in the Quran twenty-five times, Mary thirty- one times (compared to eighteen times in the Bible), whereas Prophet Muḥammad is mentioned by name only four times. Sûrah 19 of the Quran is named after Mary. Muslims believe that Jesus is the Christ and the Messiah. They also believe in his virgin birth, ascension, and second coming. Below is a list of all the prophets mentioned by name in the Quran, each followed by transliteration of the corresponding Arabic name:",
        "translation": "*** COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT ISLAM What Is Islam? Islam did not start with Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the 7th century. Technically, Islam is the message that was delivered by all the prophets of Allah from Adam (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Islam is neither named after a person or a tribe nor does it end with an –ism. Though each prophet had a relatively different law, the essence of the message of Islam was always the same: have faith in one God and do good. In the Bible, the first four of the Ten Commandments enjoin the worship of one God; the rest urge believers to avoid what is wrong and to do what is good. All prophets and their followers (including Jesus and his disciples) are simply called “Muslims” in the Quran. Hence, anyone who submits to Allah and strives to be a good person can be called a ‘muslim’ (with a small ‘m’) from a linguistic perspective. Every human being is born with the innate will (fi ṭrah) to submit to Allah, but parents and society change this nature, and in order to relate to the Almighty, many have put a face on God (mostly human or animal) throughout history. The process of restoring the fi ṭrah is called reversion. Islam is not only a religion, but a comprehensive way of life. Based on common sense and clear-cut teachings, Islam defines the rights and responsibilities of every individual in regards to their relationship with Allah and His creation. It balances the spiritual and material needs of its followers and helps them gain happiness in this life and salvation in the next. Who Is a Muslim? A ‘Muslim’ (with a capital ‘M’) is someone who practices Islam. Muslims follow the five pillars of Islam: -Shahâdah, testifying that there is only One God and Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is His last Prophet - Ṣalâh, praying five times a day - Ṣawm, fasting from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramaḍân -Zakâh, paying alms-tax on savings worth 85 g of gold or more, if the amount is kept for a year - Ḥajj, performing pilgrimage to Mecca, if physically and financially able to. Muslims also believe in the six articles of faith: -Almighty Allah -His angels -His prophets -His scriptures -Free choice, fate, and destiny -The Day of Judgment Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. Totalling 1.6 billion, Muslims make up one-quarter of the world’s population. Muslims come from different ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds. Contrary to the common belief, not all Muslims are Arab; not all Arabs are Muslim. Arabs make up less than 18% of the world’s Muslim population. Indonesia (a single non-Arab Muslim country in Southeast Asia) has more Muslims than all Arab countries combined. Islam should not be judged by what any Muslim does, but Muslims should be judged based on what Islam teaches. Islam is perfect; Muslims are not. Who Is Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص)? The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was born in Mecca in the year 570 C.E. His father died before his birth and his mother died when he was six years old. As he grew up, he acquired the epithet ‘the trustworthy.’ Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had long detested the idolatry, social injustice, and corruption found in society. At the age of forty, he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received the first revelation of the Quran from Allah through the angel Gabriel. Since the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) could not read or write, he had scribes write down passages over the course of their revelation. The Quran was also memorized word for word by the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and many of his companions. Although the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) performed many miracles, such as the splitting of the moon (see ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص 54:1), water gushing out from between his fingers, multiplying food, still the Quran is his greatest miracle. Just like many previous prophets, Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his early followers were persecuted—and some were even killed—for advocating revolutionary ideas such as social justice and women’s rights. As the persecution grew fierce, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and many of his companions emigrated to the city of Medina, 260 miles to the north of Mecca. This emigration (Hijrah) marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. After several years, Mecca ultimately surrendered peacefully to Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) who issued a universal amnesty. Before the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) passed away at the age of sixty-three, the greater part of the Arabian Peninsula had become Muslim, and within a century of his death, Islam had spread to Spain in the west and as far east as China. The rapid spread of Islam (especially to territories previously occupied by the Byzantine and Persian empires) was mostly because of its simple teachings and social justice. Why Do Muslims Call God ‘Allah’? Arab Muslims, Christians, and Jews call God ‘Allah.’ The word ‘Allah’ is unique in the sense that it has no plural or gender. It literally means in Arabic “the One, True God.” Allah has many attributes and beautiful names such as the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, the All-Loving, the Judge, the Creator, and the Provider. In his native tongue of Aramaic, Jesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) used Alaha to refer to Allah. Moses (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) used, among other things, Eloh in Hebrew. Allah, Alaha, and Eloh come from three Semitic languages: Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew respectively. What Is the Quran? The Quran is the holy book of Islam. It is a collection of revelations that were received by the Prophet Muhammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) over the course of twenty-three years in the 7th century C.E. There is only one version of the Quran, perfectly preserved in written and oral records around the world for nearly 1400 years. The Quran is the only book in history that has been memorized verbatim by millions of people. Sûrahs were written down separately during ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص the life of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and were collected in one volume within two years of his death. Exact copies were later duplicated from the original collection during the reign of the 3rd Caliph, ’Uthmân ibn ’Affân, and sent to major Muslim cities. Today, all copies of the Quran (called ma ṣâḥif, plural of mu ṣḥaf) are perfect duplicates of the original. The Quran emphasizes universal ethics such as honesty, sincerity, generosity, mercy, and standing up for what is right. It aims at humanizing humanity and deifying Allah and therefore condemns those who personify Allah and idolize their fellow created beings. Was the Quran Copied from the Bible? It is worth mentioning that the first Arabic translation of the Bible was done centuries after the Prophet’s death. From an Islamic point of view, similarities between the Quran and the Bible (especially historical stories such as that of Joseph, Moses, and Jesus) stem from the fact that both scriptures came originally from the same source—divine revelation. Because of differences in transmission and interpretation of the Bible, over time the stories changed. The Quranic narratives now appear slightly different, for example, unlike the Quran (20:120-122), in the book of Genesis, Eve was tempted to eat from the tree and therefore she is to blame for the Fall. Also, according to the Quran (Sûrah 19), prophets are infallible of sin. But in the Bible, some prophets are guilty of shameful and even criminal acts. For example, David impregnated his neighbour’s wife (Bathsheba) before conspiring to get her husband (Uriah) killed (II Samuel 11:1-27), Lot had sex with his two daughters (Genesis 19:30-38), and Noah got drunk and naked (Genesis 9:20-21). Some Biblical stories are not in the Quran and vice versa. For example, the Biblical story of Isaiah is not in the Quran, while the story of Moses and Al-Khaḍir mentioned in Sûrah 18 of the Quran is not in the Bible. Also, there are three miracles of Jesus in the Quran that are not in the Bible (see 5:110-115). Although both scriptures emphasize global ethics (such as dignity, kindness, and charity), each revolves around a different theology. Both have contrasting views on the perception of Allah, Jesus, salvation, crucifixion, and the original sin. Is Islam Compatible with Science? Although the Quran is a book of signs, not a book of science, there are many scientific references in the Quran such as the formation and developmental phases of an embryo in the uterus (23:12–14 and 22:5), the Big Bang (21:30), the constant expansion of the universe (51:47–8), spherical shape of the earth (39:5 and 79:30), the earth’s rotation (27:88), and many others that have become known only in the last two centuries. According to an Arab proverb, “The ink of a scholar is holier than the blood of a martyr.” Islam’s emphasis on education galvanized learning and science in the Muslim world culminating in what is known as the Islamic Golden Age. For centuries, Muslims pioneered medicine, anatomy, mathematics, geography, astronomy, architecture, and many other sciences. Algebra, alchemy, and alcohol are all Arabic words. The Canon of Medicine by Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037 C.E.) was a primary medical text in medieval Europe for more than 700 years. Many surgical tools that are in use today were invented by Albucasis (Alzahrâwi, 936-1013 C.E.). Mariam Al-Astrolabiya, a female Muslim scholar who lived in the 10th century in Syria, was famous for designing and constructing astrolabes. Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) are used worldwide. Muslims invented numerous sciences and developed many others (which they had inherited from the Romans, Greeks, Persians, Indians, and others) and laid the foundations to the European industrial revolution. The invention of cameras, computers, and navigation systems could not have been possible without the contributions of Muslim scholars. What Is Sharia Law? Linguistically, Sharia means a pathway. Technically, it is the Muslim law, derived mainly from the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), governing every aspect of a Muslim’s life. Sharia is made up of thousands of teachings and rulings covering theology, acts of worship, manners, human interactions, business transactions, family relations (marriage, divorce, inheritance, etc.), war and peace, belief in the unseen (Allah, angels, and the Hereafter), and criminal law. Sharia mainly aims at protecting 5 things: 1) Life 2) Honour 3) Freedom to practice one’s faith 4) Intellect 5) Property. Therefore, there are punishments in Islamic Law for violating any of these rights. Every country has punishments for offences—even though the penalty for the same crime may vary from one country to another. To say that Sharia is all about chopping people’s hands off is like saying that the American law is all about killing people with the electric chair! Sharia does not apply to non- Muslim minorities living in predominantly Muslim countries. Of the fifty- seven Muslim countries in the world, the great majority are secular, not Sharia-based. Muslims living in the West follow the law of the land and maintain Sharia mainly in personal matters (such as prayers, marriage, and inheritance). Sharia also forbids the consumption of pork, alcohol, and drugs. Smoking is frowned upon. Is Islam Compatible with Modern Democracy? We have to make the distinction between what Islam teaches and how countries in the Muslim world are run. As pointed out earlier, many Muslim countries are secular-based, not fully subscribing to Islamic morals or western democratic values. Islam and modern democracies have many things in common. For example, the fundamental principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are acceptable Islamically. What makes Islamic values unique is that they do not change over time, what is right in the sight of Allah is always right and what is wrong is always wrong. On the other hand, many secular freedoms (which have been mostly adopted in the last few decades) are still subject to debate in western societies. For example, marijuana, same-sex marriage, abortion, incest, and prostitution are legal in some democracies and illegal in some others. The same applies to euthanasia and the death penalty. Moreover, in a secular society, the majority’s opinion prevails. In the Islamic concept of shûra, the truth prevails even if it is held by a minority. For example, the segregation of blacks and whites under the Jim Crow Laws would be prohibited under Sharia, since discrimination based on colour goes against Islamic beliefs. Does Jihad Equal Terrorism? Life is sacred in Islam. The Quran (5:32) states, “Whoever takes a life …, it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity.” Those who manipulate verses from the Quran by taking them out of context to justify violence against innocents contradict the Quran’s call for tolerance and peaceful co-existence. Islam is unequivocally against terrorism (see 5:33). Jihad means to strive for a better, more righteous life. The major jihad is to overcome one’s desires (such as greed). Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) says, “The highest form of jihad is to speak a word of truth in the presence of a tyrant,” “Kindness to parents is a form of jihad,” and “Charity to orphans and widows is jihad.” The minor jihad is fighting in self-defence. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) set the etiquettes of fighting as follows: “Do not ask Allah to meet your enemies in battle” and “Do not start a war. If you must fight, then strike only at those ˹combatants˺ who attacked you. Do not attack women, children, the elderly, or those retreating in their places of worship. Do not cut down trees or kill animals.” We have to keep in mind that all violent passages in the Quran (including verses in sûrahs 2, 8, 9, 47, and 48) strictly concern conflicts between early Muslims and the pagans of Mecca over 1400 years ago. As such, all passages should be understood in their historical context. In Islam, fighting is allowed against aggressors regardless of their faith. Fighting against innocents is prohibited regardless of their faith. Overall, violent passages in the Quran talk about one of three things: -Fighting back in self-defence. -Making peace if attackers cease. -Or resuming the fight if a truce is violated. What is the Origin of Religious Violence? No religion condones the killing of innocents, but some people manipulate religion to justify acts of violence. So, even if Islam and other faiths have never existed, humans would have come up with other excuses to fight for domination. We have seen notorious anti-religion, secularist ideologies, like those championed by Mao and Stalin (the top mass murderers in modern history), which were responsible for over seventy million deaths in the 20th century. Most victims of violence in the Muslim world are Muslims, who are either killed by unjustified wars, suicide bombs, or drone attacks. Over the last few decades, hundreds of thousands have been killed—most of them civilians—and many others wounded or displaced. Justice, dignity, and education, some of the most fundamental aspects of human rights, are the key to peace and prosperity anywhere in the world. Are Women Abused in Islam? The Quran makes it clear that men and women are equal before Allah and the Law (16:97 and 33:35). Abuses against some Muslim women (e.g., honour killing and forced marriages) are cultural practices in some Muslim countries that contradict Islamic teachings. There are many prominent Muslim women in every field: education, science, business, etc. Several Muslim women have been elected president and prime minister in Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Turkey. The high status of women in Islam explains why 75% of reverts to Islam are women. Why Do Muslim Women Wear the Hijab? The veil is deeply rooted in all Abrahamic traditions. Christian icons such as Mary and Mother Teresa are always depicted with veils. In the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), both men and women are urged to be modest in their dress and behaviour. Hijab is worn by adult Muslim women in the presence of adult males outside of their immediate family. What Are the Rights of Non-Muslims in Islam? Islam guarantees the freedom of non-Muslims to practice their faith and protection for their places of worship. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said, “Whoever harms a non-Muslim under the protection of Islam, I shall be their opponent on Judgment Day and they will not even smell Paradise.” The Quran teaches that there are three types of brotherhood: brotherhood in humanity (this includes all human beings), biological brotherhood (one’s siblings), and brotherhood in faith (fellow Muslims). Islam allows giving charity to non-Muslims and exchanging gifts and visits with them. The Quran (60:8-9) exhorts Muslims to be kind and generous to non-Muslims. It forbids forcing non-Muslims to convert to Islam (2:256). For centuries, non-Muslim communities thrived under Muslim rule. Many Christians and Jews occupied prominent positions in the courts of some Muslim caliphs, serving as translators, physicians, and architects. Do Muslims Believe in Other Prophets? The Quran mentions twenty-five prophets by name—of whom five are given the honorary title of ‘the Messengers of Firm Resolve,’ namely Abraham, Noah, Moses, Jesus, and Muḥammad. The Quran (12:111) says, “In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason.” Some of the most common names in the Muslim world include ’Îsa (Jesus in Arabic), Mûsa (Moses), Mariam (Mary), Yûsuf (Joseph), and Ibrâhîm (Abraham). Jesus is mentioned by name in the Quran twenty-five times, Mary thirty- one times (compared to eighteen times in the Bible), whereas Prophet Muḥammad is mentioned by name only four times. Sûrah 19 of the Quran is named after Mary. Muslims believe that Jesus is the Christ and the Messiah. They also believe in his virgin birth, ascension, and second coming.

He taught that a good deed done to an animal is like a good deed done to a human being, while an act of cruelty to an animal is as bad as cruelty to a human being. He prohibited the use of live birds and animals as a target for arrows, the killing of animals for sport, slaughtering an animal in front of other animals, and forbade overburdening animals and underfeeding them. On the Treatment of Others The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said that smiling is a charity and taught: “They are not of us, those who do not show respect to our seniors or show mercy to our youngsters.” He gave women the right to inheritance, education, to own property, and have a say in marriage and said, “The best among the believers are those who are best to their wives,” and that Paradise lies under the feet of the mother. He (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received Christians in his mosque and allowed them to pray there when the time for their prayers came. He also commemorated the day Moses and the Children of Israel were saved from Pharaoh and his army by fasting and ordering Muslims to fast—a practice that has continued until today. He (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) said, “O humanity! Your Lord is one and your ancestry [i.e., Adam and Eve] is one. No Arab is superior to a non-Arab and no non- Arab is superior to an Arab, nor is any white superior to any black or any black superior to any white except on account of their piety,” and “None of you truly believes until they love for others what they love for themselves.” On the Best Way of Life ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) set out a way of life through his own example, but he also had the following to say on living a fulfilling life. “The ˹true˺ Muslim is the one who does not harm people with his hands or tongue.” “Seeking knowledge is an obligation on every Muslim.” “Don’t respond to evil by evil, but by doing what is good.” “Show mercy to those on earth and Allah will show mercy to you.” “Take advantage of five matters before the coming of five things: your health before you fall sick, your wealth before you become poor, your free time before you become busy, your youth before you become old, and your life before your death.” “Be mindful of Allah and He will always be with you. Remember Allah in times of prosperity and He will remember you in times of adversity. And know that what has passed you by [and you have failed to attain] was not going to befall you, and what has befallen you was not going to pass you by. And know that victory comes with perseverance, relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.” *** WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT MUḤAMMAD (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) “My choice of Muḥammad to lead the list of the world's most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular levels.” --Michael H.

He taught that a good deed done to an animal is like a good deed done to a human being, while an act of cruelty to an animal is as bad as cruelty to a human being. He prohibited the use of live birds and animals as a target for arrows, the killing of animals for sport, slaughtering an animal in front of other animals, and forbade overburdening animals and underfeeding them.

They also have the right to waive the punishment as an act of charity. [56] No one else should be executed in place of the killer. This verse was revealed regarding a particular incident. Nevertheless, the killer is killed regardless of the difference in gender or status, unless the victim’s family opts for blood money. [57] The guardian is the victim’s closest heir—male or female. [58] Or according to common law. [59] This ruling should be understood in light of the inheritance laws in 4:11- 12, which give specific shares to parents and close relatives. Relatives who do not have a share may get a bequest up to one third of the estate. [60] After the death of the one who made the will. [61] i.e., the followers of previous prophets.

[65] Initially, intimate relations during the night of Ramaḍân were not permissible. Since some Muslims could not resist not having intercourse with their spouses, this verse was revealed allowing intimacy during the nights preceding the fast. [66] This implies offspring. [67] Before Islam, there was a superstitious practice for pilgrims to enter their homes through the back door upon returning from the pilgrimage. The verse suggests that being devoted to Allah wholeheartedly is more important than blindly following old traditions. [68] “Do not exceed the limits” refers to Islamic warfare guidelines set by the Prophet. In an authentic saying collected by Abu Dawûd, he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reported to have instructed the Muslim army, “Depart in the Name of Allah and with His help—following the way of the Messenger of Allah. Do not kill an old man, a child, or a woman. Do not mutilate dead bodies of the enemy. Be gracious and courteous, for Allah loves those who act with grace.” The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) also says, “Do not wish to meet your enemy in battle but always pray for well-being. If fighting is a must, then be steadfast.” [69] This is probably the most misquoted verse from the Quran. To properly understand the verse, we need to put it into context. Misquoting verses and taking them out of context can be applied to any scripture. For example, in the Bible, Jesus says, “Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword!” (Matthew 10:34). He also says, “But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king— bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!” (Luke 19:27).

        "translation": "[55] The closest heirs of the victim of an intentional killing have the right to demand the execution of the killer through legal channels. They also have the right to waive the punishment as an act of charity. [56] No one else should be executed in place of the killer. This verse was revealed regarding a particular incident. Nevertheless, the killer is killed regardless of the difference in gender or status, unless the victim’s family opts for blood money. [57] The guardian is the victim’s closest heir—male or female. [58] Or according to common law. [59] This ruling should be understood in light of the inheritance laws in 4:11- 12, which give specific shares to parents and close relatives. Relatives who do not have a share may get a bequest up to one third of the estate. [60] After the death of the one who made the will. [61] i.e., the followers of previous prophets. [62] i.e., the month of Ramaḍân, the 9th month in the Islamic calendar. [63] In the case of old age or chronic disease. [64] “Garment” (libâs) is a metaphor for comfort, chastity, and protection. [65] Initially, intimate relations during the night of Ramaḍân were not permissible. Since some Muslims could not resist not having intercourse with their spouses, this verse was revealed allowing intimacy during the nights preceding the fast. [66] This implies offspring. [67] Before Islam, there was a superstitious practice for pilgrims to enter their homes through the back door upon returning from the pilgrimage. The verse suggests that being devoted to Allah wholeheartedly is more important than blindly following old traditions. [68] “Do not exceed the limits” refers to Islamic warfare guidelines set by the Prophet. In an authentic saying collected by Abu Dawûd, he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reported to have instructed the Muslim army, “Depart in the Name of Allah and with His help—following the way of the Messenger of Allah. Do not kill an old man, a child, or a woman. Do not mutilate dead bodies of the enemy. Be gracious and courteous, for Allah loves those who act with grace.” The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) also says, “Do not wish to meet your enemy in battle but always pray for well-being. If fighting is a must, then be steadfast.” [69] This is probably the most misquoted verse from the Quran. To properly understand the verse, we need to put it into context. Misquoting verses and taking them out of context can be applied to any scripture. For example, in the Bible, Jesus says, “Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword!” (Matthew 10:34). He also says, “But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king— bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!” (Luke 19:27). And Moses says, “The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name.” (Exodus 15:3). For more details, see the Introduction. [70] Persecuting Muslims to abandon their faith.

Even if two women were available at the time of signing the contract, perhaps the primary witness might not be able to recall the details of the contract or appear before a judge because of compelling circumstances such as pregnancy or delivery.

As for giving testimony, a ruling can be made based on available testimony, regardless of the number or gender of the witnesses. For example, the beginning of Ramaḍân is usually confirmed by the sighting of the new moon, regardless of the gender of the person who sights the moon. Also the highest form of witness in Islam is for someone to testify they heard a narration (or ḥadîth) from the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). An authentic ḥadîth is accepted by all Muslims regardless of the gender of the narrator. Moreover, if a husband accuses his wife of adultery and he has no witnesses, each spouse must testify five times that they are telling the truth and the other side is lying.

This battle came only a year after the Meccan army was defeated at the Battle of Badr by the vastly outnumbered Muslim army. Initially, Muslims were winning the second battle. However, events took a different turn when the archers, who had been positioned by the Prophet on the mount of Uḥud, left their strategic position in pursuit of spoils of war—allowing a surprise attack by the Meccan cavalry. Many Muslims were martyred and Prophet Muḥammad himself was injured. 156] When the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was injured at the Battle of Uḥud, some of his companions suggested that he should pray against the pagans of Mecca. He responded, “I have not come to condemn people, but as a mercy to pray for their guidance.” The verse here says that it is not up to the Prophet whether they believe or disbelieve. A prophet’s only duty is to convey the message. Eventually, almost all Meccans accepted Islam before the death of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). 157] “This” either refers to how the forces of evil are ultimately destroyed, or that the Quran is a reminder of the destruction of evildoers. 158] The faith of many Muslims was shaken when the pagan army spread rumours that Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was killed in the Battle of Uḥud. 159] The archers disputed whether to keep their positions after the initial victory. Eventually, most of them decided to go in pursuit of the spoils of war, disobeying the Prophet’s direct orders not to leave their position no matter what happened. Defeat became inevitable. [160] i.e., the hypocrites. [161] i.e., try not to die when your time comes. 162] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) realized that the city of Medina became vulnerable after the Muslim loss at Uḥud. So on the next day of the battle he decided to lead a small force of his companions—many of whom had been wounded at Uḥud—to chase away the Meccan army which was camping at a place called Ḥamrâ' Al-Asad—not far from Medina. Abu Sufyân, commander of the Meccan army, sent a man to discourage the Muslims from following the Meccans. Although the man falsely claimed that the Meccans were mobilizing to launch a decisive attack on Medina, the Prophet became more determined to chase them away. Eventually, the Meccans decided to flee and not waste their victory after the Prophet sent a revert to Islam—who was friends with Abu Sufyân—to convince him to withdraw; otherwise Muslims were going to avenge their loss at Uḥud. 163] This refers to the warning mentioned in 3:",

Allah made the main culprit who betrayed Jesus look exactly like Jesus, while the culprit was crucified. Similar to Christians, Muslims believe in the second coming of Jesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). [139] As a testament to your prophethood. [140] The perception of Jesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). [141] Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) being Jewish or Christian. 142] Linguistically, “Muslim” means “someone who has submitted themselves to Allah.” [143] Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). [144] “Gentiles” here refers to the pagans of Arabia. [145] Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). [146] i.e., full submission to the Will of Allah. 147] Their repentance will not be accepted if they die as disbelievers. [148] Jacob (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). 149] When Jacob fell sick, he made camel meat unlawful for himself, but not for the rest of his people. 150] Pilgrimage is obligatory on every Muslim at least once in their lifetime if the person is physically and financially able. 151] Meaning, always be conscious of Him; obedient and grateful to Him. [152] lit., except as Muslims. [153] i.e., Allah’s covenant. [154] i.e., they can only annoy you with their words. 155] Uḥud is the name of the location where a battle took place in 3 A.H./625 C.E. between 750 Muslims and 3700 Meccans. This battle came only a year after the Meccan army was defeated at the Battle of Badr by the vastly outnumbered Muslim army. Initially, Muslims were winning the second battle. However, events took a different turn when the archers, who had been positioned by the Prophet on the mount of Uḥud, left their strategic position in pursuit of spoils of war—allowing a surprise attack by the Meccan cavalry. Many Muslims were martyred and Prophet Muḥammad himself was injured. 156] When the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was injured at the Battle of Uḥud, some of his companions suggested that he should pray against the pagans of Mecca. He responded, “I have not come to condemn people, but as a mercy to pray for their guidance.” The verse here says that it is not up to the Prophet whether they believe or disbelieve. A prophet’s only duty is to convey the message. Eventually, almost all Meccans accepted Islam before the death of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). 157] “This” either refers to how the forces of evil are ultimately destroyed, or that the Quran is a reminder of the destruction of evildoers. 158] The faith of many Muslims was shaken when the pagan army spread rumours that Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was killed in the Battle of Uḥud. 159] The archers disputed whether to keep their positions after the initial victory. Eventually, most of them decided to go in pursuit of the spoils of war, disobeying the Prophet’s direct orders not to leave their position no matter what happened. Defeat became inevitable. [160] i.e., the hypocrites. [161] i.e., try not to die when your time comes. 162] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) realized that the city of Medina became vulnerable after the Muslim loss at Uḥud. So on the next day of the battle he decided to lead a small force of his companions—many of whom had been wounded at Uḥud—to chase away the Meccan army which was camping at a place called Ḥamrâ' Al-Asad—not far from Medina. Abu Sufyân, commander of the Meccan army, sent a man to discourage the Muslims from following the Meccans. Although the man falsely claimed that the Meccans were mobilizing to launch a decisive attack on Medina, the Prophet became more determined to chase them away. Eventually, the Meccans decided to flee and not waste their victory after the Prophet sent a revert to Islam—who was friends with Abu Sufyân—to convince him to withdraw; otherwise Muslims were going to avenge their loss at Uḥud. 163] This refers to the warning mentioned in 3:"

In some cases, bad things happen to good people to test their faith, or as an atonement for their sins, or as part of a process of replacing something with what is better (e.g., a job or a spouse). 211] i.e., when they get the news of victory or a threat. 212] The verse discusses a group of people who nominally became Muslims and secretly supported the enemies of Muslims. For those hypocrites to prove their loyalty, they were commanded to emigrate and join the ranks of the believers, or they would be considered enemies. 213] If a Muslim commits a major sin (such as intentional killing or adultery) and dies without repenting, they will be punished in Hell according to the severity or magnitude of the sin, then eventually be taken out of Hell. No Muslim will stay in Hell forever. [214] i.e., spoils of war. [215] This includes women, the elderly, the sick, etc. 216] This verse refers to some of those who had accepted Islam secretly in Mecca but refused to emigrate to Medina along with the rest of the believers. Some of them were killed in the Battle of Badr when they were rallied by the Meccans to fight against the Muslims. The verse also applies to any Muslim who accepts abuse and refuses to move to another place where they can live with dignity and practice their faith freely. 217] Generally, it is permissible for Muslims who are travelling a distance of 85 km or more to shorten their prayers. A four-unit prayer is reduced to two. 218] When the first group prays, the second group stands guard behind them, then the first group withdraws to the back when they finish their prayers and stand guard when the second group moves up to pray. 219] Verses 105-112 were revealed in defence of Zaid ibn As-Samîn, a Jewish man, who was falsely accused of theft. A shield was stolen by a Muslim named Ṭu’mah ibn Obairaq and entrusted to Zaid. Ṭu’mah’s family rushed to his defence and accused Zaid of the crime. They also tried to influence Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to make a decision in favour of Ṭu’mah and punish the Jew, but the verses were soon revealed declaring Zaid’s innocence. 220] lit., deceive themselves. 221] This applies to those who die in a state of disbelief in Allah. But those who repent before their death and mend their ways, their repentance will be accepted (see 25:68-70). 222] The pagans of Arabia used to shape their idols as females and give them feminine names such as Al-Lât, Al-’Uzza, and Manât. 223] Slitting the ears of cattle dedicated to idols was a superstitious practice before Islam. [224] This refers to verses 2-11 of this sûrah. 225] i.e., their inheritance and dowries. 226] This implies that many husbands and wives are unwilling to give the other their rights. 227] Do not leave one hanging—not fully enjoying the rights of a married woman and not fully divorced.

Since this constitutes a declaration of war, it would not be fitting to open with the mention of Allah’s compassion and mercy. 351] The 10th of Ⱬul- Ḥijjah, a significant day in the greater pilgrimage ( ḥajj).

The treaty was violated by the Meccans in 8 A.H/630 C.E. 354] After the Muslims’ victory in Mecca in 8 A.H/630 C.E., almost all Arab tribes pledged allegiance to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) except some tribes such as Hawâzin and Thaqîf. Both tribes decided to attack the Muslims, so the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) led an army of 12 000 soldiers to attack the two tribes. Since that was the largest Muslim army ever mobilized, some Muslims expressed their conviction that such an army could not be defeated. However, on the way to battle, the Muslim army was ambushed and most soldiers fled, except for the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and a few loyalists.

General verses talk about belief in Allah, good manners, and acts of worship. Specific verses, such as this verse, were revealed in regards to particular situations. This sûrah came at a time when the pagans of Arabia (and their allies) repeatedly violated treaties they had signed with the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). Muslims had to fight for the survival of their newly established state in Medina. So this verse discusses dealing with those who violated their agreements and attacked the Muslims. Offenders were fought, unless they stopped their aggression. If they chose not to accept Islam, they were obligated to pay Jizya-tax. 361] Taxation systems have existed since ancient times. There are several references in the Old Testament (e.g., Ezra 4:20). In the New Testament, Jesus allows paying taxes to Caesar (Luke 20:25). Under Islamic rule, all individuals had financial obligations—Muslims paid zakâh (2.5% of their savings) and non-Muslims ( ⱬimmîs) were required to pay jizyah (tax for protection from foreign enemies). The jizyah was an average of one dinar (4.25 g of gold) annually. Women, children, the elderly, the clergy, the poor, and those who were unable to work were exempt. Those who opted to join the army were also exempt. Poor ⱬimmîs were supported financially by the state. Muslim rulers refunded the jizyah if they failed to protect their non-Muslim subjects. 362] When ’Adi ibn Ḥâtim, a companion of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), heard this verse, he said, “But the Jews and Christians do not worship their rabbis and monks!” The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) replied, “Do the rabbis and monks not forbid the permissible and permit the forbidden, and they obey them?” ’Adi answered, “Yes, they do.” The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) concluded, “This is how they worship them.” Collected by At-Tirmiⱬi. [363] i.e., religion of truth. 364] i.e., the Preserved Tablet in which everything is written. 365] The sacred months are the 11th, 12th, 1st, and 7th of the Islamic calendar. Since the polytheists knew that it was forbidden to fight in the sacred months, they used to transfer the sanctity to other months, say for example, the 3rd, 4th, 8th, and 10th as long as they maintained the sanctity of any four months throughout the year. 366] The fast pace of the spread of Islam in Arabia in the 7th century was intimidating to the world’s two superpowers of that time: the Romans and Persians. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) received the news that a Roman army was being mobilized to launch an attack on the newly established Muslim state in Medina, so he announced that he was going to march to Tabûk, located over 700 miles to the north, to meet the Romans in the summer of 9 A.H./631 C.E. It was a time of hardship because of the scorching heat, the long distance, and the financial situation of the Muslims. Although the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was able to mobilize over 30 000 Muslims for battle, many others did not join the army with or without valid excuses. Eventually, the Roman forces were discouraged from fighting and fled to Damascus and other cities under Roman rule. Therefore, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) returned to Medina with a feeling of triumph. With a new power now emerging in Arabia, many tribes started to switch their alliances from Caesar to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). 367] Abu Bakr Aṣ-Ṣiddîq, Islam’s first Caliph and a prominent figure in Islamic history. He accompanied the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) during his emigration from Mecca to Medina after years of persecution at the hands of the Meccan pagans. 368] For example, ’Abdullâh ibn Ubai ibn Salûl, a chief hypocrite, marched with the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) for the Battle of Uḥud in the outskirts of Medina, then decided not to join the fight and returned to Medina with his followers who made up around one third of the Muslim army. 369] Another hypocrite by the name of Jadd ibn Qais came to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) asking to be exempt from joining the army because he had a weakness for women and he was afraid that he would be tempted by Roman women. 370] i.e., those who will repent. 371] The overturned cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. 372] i.e., some of them tried to assassinate the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) on the way back from Tabûk. 373] Not only did the hypocrites withhold their wealth, but they were also critical of those who donated. If a rich believer gave generously, the hypocrites would say, “He is showing off,” and if a poor believer gave what they could afford, they would say, “This is not good enough.” 374] i.e., the early Muslims who emigrated from Mecca to Medina, known as Al-Muhâjirûn. 375] i.e., those from Medina, known as Al-An ṣâr, who accepted Islam and sheltered Muslim emigrants from Mecca. 376] Through disgrace in this world and bad ending of their lives. 377] They have mixed their adherence to Islam with their disobedience to march forth with the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to Tabûk. 378] This verse refers to Ka’b ibn Mâlik, Murarah ibn Rabi’, and Hilâl ibn Umaiyah, the three companions who remained in Medina with no excuse, but were honest about what they did. They were boycotted by Muslims for about fifty days until verses 118-119 of this sûrah were revealed declaring the acceptance of their repentance. 3 7 9 ] Abu ’Âmer Ar-Râhib was a monk who fought against Muslims at the Battle of Badr. He ordered a group of twelve hypocrites to build a mosque near the Mosque of Qubâ', the first mosque built by Muslims and also where the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his companions would pray. The new mosque, commonly referred to as Masjid A ḍ- Ḍirâr (Mosque of Harm), was intended to attract other hypocrites and reduce the number of Muslims who prayed at Qubâ'. The hypocrites who built the mosque also anticipated the arrival of Abu ’Âmer with Roman forces to expel the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and Muslims out of Medina. Upon a request from these hypocrites, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had planned to visit the new mosque once he returned from Tabûk, but verses 107-110 of this sûrah were revealed, warning the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) against that mosque. According to some narrations, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) ordered this mosque to be burned down. [380] See footnote for 7:",

He accompanied the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) during his emigration from Mecca to Medina after years of persecution at the hands of the Meccan pagans. 368] For example, ’Abdullâh ibn Ubai ibn Salûl, a chief hypocrite, marched with the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) for the Battle of Uḥud in the outskirts of Medina, then decided not to join the fight and returned to Medina with his followers who made up around one third of the Muslim army. 369] Another hypocrite by the name of Jadd ibn Qais came to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) asking to be exempt from joining the army because he had a weakness for women and he was afraid that he would be tempted by Roman women. 370] i.e., those who will repent. 371] The overturned cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. 372] i.e., some of them tried to assassinate the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) on the way back from Tabûk. 373] Not only did the hypocrites withhold their wealth, but they were also critical of those who donated. If a rich believer gave generously, the hypocrites would say, “He is showing off,” and if a poor believer gave what they could afford, they would say, “This is not good enough.” 374] i.e., the early Muslims who emigrated from Mecca to Medina, known as Al-Muhâjirûn. 375] i.e., those from Medina, known as Al-An ṣâr, who accepted Islam and sheltered Muslim emigrants from Mecca. 376] Through disgrace in this world and bad ending of their lives. 377] They have mixed their adherence to Islam with their disobedience to march forth with the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to Tabûk. 378] This verse refers to Ka’b ibn Mâlik, Murarah ibn Rabi’, and Hilâl ibn Umaiyah, the three companions who remained in Medina with no excuse, but were honest about what they did. They were boycotted by Muslims for about fifty days until verses 118-119 of this sûrah were revealed declaring the acceptance of their repentance. 3 7 9 ] Abu ’Âmer Ar-Râhib was a monk who fought against Muslims at the Battle of Badr. He ordered a group of twelve hypocrites to build a mosque near the Mosque of Qubâ', the first mosque built by Muslims and also where the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his companions would pray. The new mosque, commonly referred to as Masjid A ḍ- Ḍirâr (Mosque of Harm), was intended to attract other hypocrites and reduce the number of Muslims who prayed at Qubâ'. The hypocrites who built the mosque also anticipated the arrival of Abu ’Âmer with Roman forces to expel the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and Muslims out of Medina. Upon a request from these hypocrites, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) had planned to visit the new mosque once he returned from Tabûk, but verses 107-110 of this sûrah were revealed, warning the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) against that mosque. According to some narrations, the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) ordered this mosque to be burned down. [380] See footnote for 7:"

[563] This is the royal ‘we’. 564] The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) commented on the story, “I wish Moses had been more patient so we can learn more from that wise man.” 5 6 5 ] This is the story of a righteous king who travelled far and wide. He is titled Ⱬul-Qarnain (lit., the man of the two horns) because of his journeys to the far east and far west (or the two horns/points of sunrise and sunset). Some believe Ⱬul-Qarnain was Alexander the Great, but this is not sound since Alexander the Great was a polytheist. Many scholars believe it was Abu Kuraib Al-Ḥamiri, a righteous king from Yemen. 566] They either had no clothes or homes to protect them from the sun. 567] Gog and Magog are two wild peoples who were sealed off by a barrier built by Ⱬul-Qarnain to stop them from raiding their peaceful neighbours. There are many speculations as to their location, but none is supported by reliable sources. Their coming out is mentioned in 21:96-97 as one of the major signs of the final Hour. [568] Gog and Magog. 569] On the Day of Judgment, the Trumpet will be blown by an angel— causing all to die. When it is blown a second time, everyone will be raised from the dead to be assembled for the Judgment (see 39:68). 570] i.e., the Quran. [571] i.e., Jesus, Ezra, and the angels. [572] Al-Firdaws, the highest place in Paradise. 573] This was the voice of baby Jesus. Some say it was Gabriel. 574] lit., fast ˹from speech˺. Linguistically, ṣawm means to abstain from something, such as food, speaking, and playing. 575] i.e., his twin in virtue. They meant that they did not expect her to do something like that because they held her in high esteem like Aaron, Moses’ brother (perhaps because she was his descendant). 576] On a daily basis, Muslims invoke Allah’s blessings upon Prophet Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his family and Prophet Abraham (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and his family, in both obligatory and optional prayers. 577] Prophet Enoch (Idrîs) (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is said to be in the fourth heaven. 578] Israel is another name for Jacob (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). 579] The word ghai can either mean the evil consequences or a valley in Hell where they will be punished. 580] There is no day or night in Paradise, only light. The verse says that the residents of Paradise will either be receiving provisions around these worldly times or without failure. Words such as morning and evening are used to make it easier for the people to understand. 581] This passage is a response to the Prophet’s request to be visited by Gabriel more often. 582] This refers to the bridge (known as A ṣ- Ṣirâ ṭ) which is extended over Hell. Both the believers and disbelievers will be made to cross that bridge. The believers will cross it safely, each at a different speed according to the strength of their faith, whereas the disbelievers and the hypocrites will plunge into the Fire. 583] See footnote for 18:"

She was part of a caravan, and when she lost her necklace and went looking for it, the caravan moved on without her. She waited until a man named Ṣafwân ibn Al-Mu’aṭṭal found her and escorted her to the caravan. When they returned, the hypocrites began accusing her of adultery. The rumour spread, and ’Ȃishah defended her innocence, saying “If I told you now I had not done this, you would not believe me. And if I told you that I had done it, you would believe me. I now say what Jacob had once said. He said (12:18): ‘˹I can only endure with˺ beautiful patience! It is Allah’s help that I seek to bear your claims.’” Right after she said this, these verses were revealed to the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص), proclaiming her innocence. 699] Because now you can tell who is a true believer and who is a hypocrite. 700] This refers to ’Abdullâh ibn Ubai, the leader of the hypocrites in Medina. 701] This verse was revealed when Abu Bakr Aṣ-Ṣiddîq, ’Ȃishah’s father, swore to end his financial assistance to his poor cousin, Misṭaḥ ibn Athathah, for taking part in the rumours against ’Ȃishah.

    "intro": "? 2. If you are truly Allah’s favourite servants then you should wish to meet Him (62:-6-8). 3. Muslims have been blessed with Friday, equivalent to the Sabbath (62:9-10). 1199] Meaning, they can carry the physical burden of the books, but not understand a word of them. 1200] i.e., disobeying Allah, killing some of the prophets (including Zachariah and John the Baptist), claiming to have killed Jesus, accusing Mary of adultery, and dealing with usury. See 4:153-158. 1201] Initially, the Friday congregational prayer was performed first, followed by the sermon. On one occasion, a caravan of food arrived in Medina during a time of hardship while the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was on the pulpit. Following ancient traditions, the caravan was received with drum-beats. Most congregants rushed to receive the caravan, leaving the Prophet ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) in the middle of the sermon. Henceforth, the sermon was given first so everyone would stay for the prayer. 1202] This passage and the next refer to ’Abdullâh ibn Ubai, the chief hypocrite in Medina. [1203] i.e., the Quran. 1204] This verse was revealed when some early Muslims were prevented from emigrating to Medina by their own spouses and children, so they could not join the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) and the rest of the believers to practice their faith freely. 1205] Meaning, when a husband intends to divorce his wife—after the consummation of marriage—he should divorce her outside her monthly cycle, provided that he has not touched her after her period. This makes it easy for the wife to observe her ’iddah (waiting period for around three months, see 65:4). Otherwise, things will be complicated for her. For example, if divorce happens after sexual intercourse, she might get pregnant, which delays the end of ’iddah until the end of her pregnancy. If divorce happens during a monthly cycle, scholars are in disagreement as to whether the divorce counts or not. If it does not, she has to wait until her menstruation is over to see if her husband still wants to divorce her. 1206] Perhaps the husband who has divorced his wife may change his mind and restore the marriage before the end of her waiting period (after the first or second count of revocable divorce). 1207] A husband may separate from his wife after each of the first two counts of divorce or at the end of her waiting period with dignity. If he chooses to stay with her after the first two counts of divorce then divorces her a third time, the marriage is terminated at the end of her third waiting period. The wife will have to marry and divorce another man before she can be remarried to her ex-husband (see 2:230). However, a woman marrying someone with the intention of getting divorced, in order to return to her first husband, is forbidden. 1208] This applies to pregnant women who are divorced or widowed. [1209] After the divorce is finalized. [1210] This is one of the names of the Quran. [1211] See 5:89. 1212] Both wives were disbelievers. Noah’s wife used to give away the identity of the new believers so the disbelievers could persecute them. And Lot’s wife used to tell the men about her husband’s handsome male visitors so they could approach them. 1213] Gabriel breathed into the sleeves of Mary’s garment so she conceived Jesus (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). 1214] Some may point to birth defects, genetic mutations, etc. and say these are flaws. This verse means that, in the grand scheme of creation, everything created has its place, form, and purpose, and that it does exactly what Allah ordained for it. [1215] See 72:8-10. 1216] This can also mean that they are in awe of their Lord as much in private as they are in public. 1217] Another possible translation: “This is what you were calling for.” 1218] Meaning, whether Allah takes our lives (as you wish) or grants us a long life, it is all good for us. But who will protect you from Allah if you disbelieve in Him. 1219] Like 53:33-35 and 74:11-26, these verses refer to Al-Walîd ibn Al- Mughîrah, a leader of the Meccan opposition against Islam. He rejected the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) as a madman, so the Quran responded by listing ten of his qualities—two of which were unknown to him: the fact that he was born out of wedlock and that his nose would be chopped off several years later at the Battle of Badr. At least three of his ten sons accepted Islam— including Khâlid ibn Al-Walîd. 1220] This is the story of a righteous man who owned a garden and used to give a share of the harvest to the poor. Following his death, his children decided to keep all the produce for themselves and give nothing to the poor. 1221] Another possible translation: “… without leaving some for the poor.” 1222] It is believed that Allah accepted their repentance and replaced their garden with a better one. [1223] i.e., if only the Meccan pagans knew. 1224] Like the Face and the Hands, the Shin is believed by many to be one of the qualities of Allah, in a way befitting His Majesty and Greatness. Since baring the shin in the Arab culture is associated with the heat of battle, some interpret the verse metaphorically, so the meaning would be: “˹Beware of˺ the Day when horror sets in.” [1225] While inside the whale. See 21:87 and 37:139-148. [1226] This is one of the names of the Quran. [1227] The Striking Disaster is another name for the Day of Judgment. [1228] i.e., your ancestors. 1229] According to 8:32, An-Naḍr ibn Al-Ḥârith challenged Allah, saying, “If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones upon us from the sky or overcome us with a painful punishment.” [1230] The holy spirit is the angel Gabriel. 1231] Judgment Day will seem like 50 000 years for a disbeliever, but it will seem like a very short period for a believer. The Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is reported in a ḥadîth collected by Imâm Aḥmed to have said that, for the believer, this long period will be like the time they took to perform a single prayer in the world. 1232] lit., private parts. [1233] See footnote for 4:3. 1234] Some Meccan pagans used to gather around the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) to mock him and the believers, saying that if there is in fact a Hereafter, they are better entitled to Paradise than the poor believers. [1235] i.e., from a humble fluid. See 32:8. 1236] The daily points of sunrise and sunset, caused by the earth’s rotation around its own axis. [1237] Or “… as if rushing towards a target.” 1238] Meaning, it is out of Allah’s mercy that He does not hasten your punishment but allows you more time to repent. [1239] See 22:5 and 23:12-14. 1240] i.e., your father Adam, who was created from clay. 1241] These are the names of their main idols. Initially, these idols had been erected to commemorate some righteous people before the time of Noah. After many generations, however, the idols were taken as objects of worship. ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص 1242] Noah (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) prayed for his people’s destruction after Allah revealed to him that no one else was going to believe. See 11:36. 1243] Meaning, evil jinn tempted some pagan Arabs to believe that the angels are Allah’s daughters through female jinn. [1244] See footnote for 6:128. 1245] Some jinn used to eavesdrop on the heaven, then pass on what they heard to fortune-tellers. But this practice came to an end once Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) was sent as a messenger with the Quran. 1246] Meaning, to see if they will be grateful to Allah for rain and other provisions. [1247] i.e., Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). 1248] This passage lightens the ruling mentioned in 73:2-4. So from now on, the believers do not have to stick to any of the portions specified at the beginning of this sûrah. Rather, they can pray whatever they can at night. [1249] i.e., giving for charity and good causes. 1250] The reward for your charity will be far better than what you left behind or what you have given in charity because it will be rewarded ten-fold, or even 700-fold, and Allah gives more to whoever He wills. See 2:261. 1251] It was a common practice to give someone a gift, hoping to receive a more valuable gift in return. This practice is disliked in Islam. 1252] This is when the Trumpet will be blown for the second time, causing everyone to rise from the dead for judgment. See 39:68. 1253] This refers to Al-Walîd ibn Al-Mughîrah, a leader of Meccan opposition against Islam. See footnote for 64:10-16. 1254] Another possible translation: “It spares none and leaves nothing.” 1255] Some pagans made fun of the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) when they were told that the keepers of Hell are nineteen angels. One of them said mockingly to other pagans, “You take care of two angels and I will vanquish the rest all by myself.” 1256] Another possible translation: “In fact, each of them wishes to be given a scripture open ˹for all to read˺.” See 6:124. 1257] This refers to the fact that every human has a unique set of fingerprints. [1258] They both will rise from the west and lose their light. [1259] Their organs will testify against them. See 41:19-24. 1260] ’Alaqah, meaning the embryo resembles a leech. 1261] This is the time before a human comes into being and as an embryo. 1262] The mixture of male and female gametes (sperm and egg) which form the zygote after fertilization. 1263] There will be no day or night, sun or moon, winter or summer in Paradise. It will always be bright and temperate. 1264] The word ṭahûr implies that once the believers take that pure drink, there will be no bad feelings in their hearts or ailments in their bodies. 1265] This verse refers to the five daily prayers: the dawn prayer, then noon and afternoon prayers, then sunset and late evening prayers, respectively. 1266] Extra prayers offered at night. See 73:20. [1267] See 23:12-14 and 22:5. 1268] lit., yellow camels. Black camels’ hair glistens yellow in sunlight. 1269] The pagans used to mock the teachings of the Quran (e.g., resurrection and judgment). They disagreed whether the Quran was magic, poetry, or fortune-telling. 1270] Just like tent pegs and icebergs, mountains go deep below the surface, slowing tectonic movement. [1271] i.e., the angel Gabriel. 1272] In the Hereafter, Allah will judge between all of His creation including animals, which will eventually become dust. The wicked will wish that they too were turned into dust so they do not have to go to the Fire, as reported in an authentic narration collected by Al-Ḥakim. 1273] The first Blast will cause everyone to die except those spared by Allah. Then the second one will cause the dead to come to life for judgment. See 39:68. 1274] The staff turning into a snake. See 20:17-23. 1275] This is from a human perspective. Otherwise, both the creation of the universe and the resurrection of humans are easy for Allah. 1276] The Arabic verb daḥa also suggests that the earth is egg-shaped. The noun form diḥya is still used in some Arab dialects to mean an egg. Based on 2:29, 41:9-12, and 79:27-33, Allah ordained both realms, then formed the earth and created its provisions, then formed the heaven into seven heavens—all in six ˹heavenly˺ Days. See footnote for 7:54. 1277] This is the second Blast which will cause the dead to come to life for judgment. See 39:68. 1278] Another possible translation: “What is this question? You ˹O Prophet˺ are one of its signs.” It is believed—based on authentic narrations from the Prophet—that he (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) is one of the signs of the Day of Judgment. 1279] This passage, along with others that are critical of some things the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) did (such as 66:1), proves that the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) delivered the revelations in all honesty. 1280] The way to true guidance or the way out of their mothers’ wombs. 1281] Burial is perceived as a way of honouring human beings after their death. 1282] This is the second Blast which will cause the dead to come to life for judgment. See 39:68. 1283] Ten-month pregnant camels were the most precious thing for nomadic Arabs. These camels were always cared for and treasured. 1284] All animals will be brought together for judgment and then they will be reduced to dust. 1285] On the Day of Judgment the oceans and seas will be on fire. 1286] Some pagan Arabs used to bury their infant daughters alive for fear of shame or poverty. This practice was condemned and abolished by Islam. See 16:58-59. 1287] This probably refers to black holes. Kanasa means to sweep or hide. Miknasah is derived from this, and is the standard word for a vacuum cleaner. [1288] lit., the day as it takes its first breath. [1289] i.e., Muḥammad (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص). 1290] This is first time the Prophet (ملسو هيلع هللا ىلص) saw Gabriel in his angelic form. He saw him a second time in heaven during the Night Journey. See 53:5- 15. [1291] See 26:210-212. 1292] Sijjîn is the name of a place (such as a confinement) in the depths of Hell. 1293] This is based on the commentary of Ibn Kathîr.
